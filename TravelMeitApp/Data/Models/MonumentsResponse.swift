  "Image": "Welcome to Barranco, one of the most picturesque and vibrant districts of Lima, Peru.   It is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, south of Miraflores and east of Chorrillos. It was named after a section of rocky cliffs, barranco in Spanish, that is located in the district.  Its first inhabitants were fisherman who lived in the neighbor district of Surco and came to the shores of Barranco to fish every day. According to a local legend, it was these fisherman who in the mid eighteen hundreds saw a light floating in the high cliffs of Barranco, approached it, only to find to their surprise that it was an image of christ crusified.    The fisherman returned to their homes and started talking about their incredible sighting. Inspired by their faith, they returned to the cliffs and built a Cross on the site where believers would come to pray and ask for themselves and their loved ones.   As the legend spread more people started to come to Barranco to pray. Eventually, a wealthy neighbor whose sick wife had been in Barranco agreed to fund the building of a church around the holy wooden cross. This is how the Ermita, the oldest church in barranco, came to be.   During these days Barranco was known as the town of the Ermita, the name Barranco had not been given to the site yet. It was just a handfull of houses built around a catholic church built on the site of a religious sighting.   Barranco neighbors like telling this story, it highlights their towns unique history and nature, because, as they say, in a country were all cities were built by indian emperors and spanish conquerors, Barranco, was founded by god ;).   As the years passed more wealthy limeños started moving to barranco’s beautiful cliffs to enjoy the amazing views of the ocean until the town was finally granted the status of district of Lima in october 1874 by the peruvian president Manuel Prado.   The war with chile of 1879 brought fire, pillage and destruction to Barranco. The towns of Chorrillos and Barranco were sacked and burned, the Ermita church was also burned, and a statue that represented the sacred christ of Barranco was lost.   The years of occupation by the Chilean army were very difficult years. Soldiers used to sack the houses and churches stealing the furnitures and any additional wealth that they could find. In 1882, when the war had ended, priest Manuel de la Fuente Chavez started rebuilding the Ermita Church with donations of neighbors and other prominent peruvian figures. The reparation of the church was finished within a year but fell into disrepair again in 1940 after a strong earthquake of 7.9 in the richter scale damaged Lima.   The 19th century saw Barranco continue to expand as a seaside resort for wealthy limeños. This attracted many foreign architects who would provide their services to design and rebuild many of the town’s old houses and palaces.   Among those was the french architect Claude Sahut, who was commissioned by the wealthy families that owned land in the area. Sahut was inspired by the French Riviera and designed Barranco with wide streets, large houses, and parks. One of the buildings designed by Sahut is the Hotel B, a very elegant hotel that belongs to the prestigious French association, Relais & Châteaux.  After the war, the renewed district became popular among the artistic and bohemian crowds, and many artists, writers, and intellectuals made it their home.   In the early 20th century, it was the center of the intellectual and artistic scene in Lima and a gathering place for many of the intellectuals of the 50’s a renowned generation of writers that included Martin Adan, Julio Ramon Ribeyro, Mari oVargas Llosa and others.   The writer Martin Adan wrote about the district in his famous book “The Cardboard House” where he describes the adolescent years of a boy living in the bohemian district.   Barranco continued to thrive in the mid-20th century, and many new buildings and parks were built. However, in the 1980s, the district was hit by an economic crisis that affected the whole country, and many of the old houses were abandoned.  In recent years, Barranco has been revitalized, and many of the old houses have been restored. The district has become a cultural center with many art galleries, theaters, and music venues. Some of the most important intellectuals and artists of Peru still hold a house in tbe area, including the famous writter Mario Vargas Llosa and the painter and sculpture Victor Delfin.   Barranco has a mild climate with temperatures that range from 15°C to 25°C throughout the year. The district has two distinct seasons: a dry season from April to November, and a wet season from December to March. The dry season is the best time to visit the district as the weather is sunny and clear.  In addition to its history and architecture, Barranco is also known for its beautiful views and seasonal weather. Located next to the ocean, Barranco offers stunning views of the Pacific Ocean and its sunsets. During the winter  the district is often covered in a misty fog known as the \"garúa,\" which gives it a unique and mystical atmosphere. We recommend you enjoy a walk through the beautiful Malecon de Barranco, a seaside promenade that runs along the Pacific Ocean from the district of Miraflores to the district of Chorrillos.   One of the most beautiful views in the Barranco promenade is the Bridge of Sighs (Puente de los Suspiros), a small wooden bridge that spans a narrow alleyway. The bridge connects two streets and is said to be named after the lovers who used to meet there and sigh. Legend has it that if you make a romantic wish while crossing the bridge of sighs that wish will come true. Couples now gather daily in the bridge to enjoy the views, make their wishes, and express their love.  References to Barranco have been included in many poems and songs. Perhaps the best well known is the waltz song \"La Flor de la Canela\" (The Cinnamon Flower) which is now considered the unofficial anthem of Barranco. The “Flor de la Canela” was witten and composed in 1950 by Chabuca Granda, a popular singer and songwritter of Lima who happened to live in Barranco. The song is a tribute to a woman from Barranco who was known for her beauty and grace.  The beauty of Barranco has been captured by many artists during the years, among them, Victor Humareda, an important peruvian paintor of the 1950s. Famous is his painting of the bridge of sighs.
