In addition to its architectural beauty and cultural events, Raekoja plats also has a rich history. The square was once used as a market square, and it was also the site of a legendary public excecution. The legend tells that In the late 1600s an angry priest threw a tankard full of warm beer at a barmaid, cracking her skull and killing her. Incensed with rage, the rabble of onlookers dragged the priest outside and demanded permission from the town hall to deliver swift, instant justice. Executions were usually enacted outside of the Old Town but such was the aggression of the mob, the priest was killed then and there. Today, the square is a much more peaceful place, with street performers and artists entertaining visitors throughout the day.    In recent years, Raekoja plats has also been the site of political demonstrations, as Estonians have used the square to express their views on various issues, including the war in Ukraine and the treatment of ethnic minorities in Estonia.

      "Medium": "Perched atop Toompea Hill in the heart of Tallinn, Toompea Castle is a remarkable medieval fortress that has witnessed centuries of history and transformations. Its origins can be traced back to the 9th century AD when it served as a stronghold for the ancient Estonians. In 1219, the castle fell into the hands of Danish crusaders led by King Valdemar II, and it became known as the Castle of the Danes.    Over the years, the castle saw several changes in ownership, including the Order of the Brethren of the Sword and the Teutonic Order. The castle underwent significant rebuilding and expansion in the 13th century, which laid the foundation for its current structure. Notable features include the imposing towers such as Pilsticker,Stür den Kerl,Landskrone, and the iconic Langer Hermann Tall Hermann, which stands at an impressive height of 48 meters and proudly flies the Estonian flag.    During the 16th century, the castle's role shifted as the region became contested by Sweden, Poland, and Muscovy. The Swedes transformed Toompea Castle into a center of political power in Estonia, turning it from a fortress into a ceremonial and administrative hub. It continued to serve this purpose after Estonia came under the rule of the Russian Empire in 1710.    In the 19th century, further modifications were made, including the addition of a new wing in Baroque and Neoclassical style, designed by Johann Schultz. This wing housed the provincial administration and the living quarters of the imperial governor. The surrounding area was transformed into a public park, enhancing the castle's surroundings.    After Estonia gained independence in 1918, the former convent building of the Teutonic Order was chosen as the site for the new parliament building, known as the Riigikogu. Completed in 1922, the parliament building exhibits a unique combination of traditionalist exterior design and Expressionist interior style, making it the world's only Expressionist parliament building.    Throughout its history, Toompea Castle has witnessed the ebb and flow of power and played a vital role in Estonia's governance.

      "Long": "Toompea Castle, majestically situated on Toompea Hill in the heart of Tallinn, is a fascinating medieval fortress that has shaped the course of Estonian history. Its origins can be traced back to the 9th century AD, when it served as an ancient Estonian stronghold. However, the castle as we see it today primarily dates back to the 13th century when extensive rebuilding and expansion took place. The castle's rich history is intertwined with the rise and fall of various powers and orders.    In 1219, Toompea Castle was seized by Danish crusaders led by King Valdemar II during the Battle of Lindanise. According to Danish legend, the flag of Denmark, known as Dannebrog, fell from the sky during the battle, marking a decisive moment. This event contributed to the castle being referred to as the Castle of the Danes or castrum danorum, giving rise to the possible origin of the city's name, Tallinn.    The castle changed hands several times over the following centuries. In 1227, the Order of the Brethren of the Sword took control and initiated rebuilding efforts. It was during this time that the castle began to resemble a monastery, with the addition of a chapel, chapter house, and dormitory for the knights. The castle's towers, including Pilsticker, Stür den Kerl, Landskrone, and the iconic Langer Hermann or Tall Hermann, were constructed under the order's rule.    In 1237, Toompea Castle was once again under Danish control, but in 1346, it was sold to the Teutonic Order, which maintained ownership throughout the Middle Ages. The castle's significance as a religious order became evident through its monastery-like features and its role as a center of power in Estonia.    During the 16th century, the Livonian War brought significant changes to the region, and the crusader orders dissolved. Sweden, Poland, and Muscovy (Russia) vied for control, leading to Swedish dominion over northern Estonia by 1561. The Swedes transformed Toompea Castle from a fortress into a ceremonial and administrative center, solidifying its position as a symbol of political power in Estonia.    In 1710, Estonia became part of the Russian Empire as a result of the Great Northern War, and Toompea Castle underwent further reconstruction. The building complex transitioned from a castle to a palace, with the addition of a new wing in Baroque and Neoclassical style designed by Johann Schultz. This wing housed the provincial administration and the living quarters of the imperial governor. The castle's surroundings were also enhanced during this period, with the creation of a public park and the construction of an adjacent archive building.    In 1918, Estonia gained independence, and the former convent building of the Teutonic Order was chosen as the site for the new parliament building, known as the Riigikogu. Designed by architects Eugen Habermann and Herbert Johanson, the parliament building was completed in 1922. Its exterior reflects traditionalist aesthetics, while the interior features an Expressionist style, making it the world's only Expressionist parliament building.    During the period of foreign occupations, which included Soviet and Nazi German rule, the parliament of Estonia was disbanded. However, Toompea Castle and the Riigikogu building continued to serve as venues for the Soviet-backed Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR.    Today, Toompea Castle stands as a symbol of Estonia's governance and heritage. Visitors can explore its historic halls, witness the parliamentary proceedings, and admire the architectural grandeur that reflects centuries of history. The castle's iconic tower, Tall Hermann, remains a prominent feature on the Tallinn skyline, and the Estonian flag is raised and lowered atop the tower each day to the sound of the national anthem.    Perched high on Toompea Hill, Toompea Castle invites visitors to delve into the captivating stories of Estonia's past, appreciate its architectural splendor, and witness firsthand the workings of the modern Estonian Parliament.",

      "Long": "Welcome to St. Olaf's Church, a remarkable testament to Tallinn's medieval heritage and architectural grandeur. This historic church, believed to have been built in the 12th century, is steeped in rich history and captivating legends that have shaped its identity.    Originally serving as the spiritual center for the Scandinavian community in Tallinn, the church was named after King Olaf II of Norway, also known as St. Olaf. Its earliest written records date back to 1267, but it underwent extensive reconstruction during the 14th century, giving it the distinctive Gothic and medieval features that we see today.    Standing tall at 124 meters, the church's spire has witnessed a tumultuous history. It has been ravaged by fires and restored multiple times, altering its height over the centuries. At its zenith, from 1549 to 1625, it proudly held the title of the tallest building in the world, reaching an awe-inspiring height of 159 meters. This remarkable feat of engineering was a testament to the city's ambition and desire for a prominent landmark visible from afar, particularly from the sea, as trade played a crucial role in Tallinn's prosperity.    One of the most intriguing aspects of St. Olaf's Church is the legend that surrounds its construction. According to the tale, the citizens of Tallinn aspired to build the tallest church in the world. However, a curse claimed the life of anyone who completed its construction, deterring all potential builders. One day, an unknown person offered to complete the task for a significant sum of money. The city, unable to afford the amount, was presented with a challenge: if they could discover the mysterious builder's name, he would forgive their debt. Determined to succeed, the people of Tallinn sent a spy to his house, who overheard the name Olev in a song sung by his wife. With this information, they waited until the foreigner completed the construction and was placing the cross on the tower. Seizing the opportunity, the crowd below shouted, Olev, the cross is crooked! Startled, the builder fell to the ground, revealing a toad and a snake that emerged from his mouth, signifying his demonic possession. This gripping legend is depicted in a mural painting on one side of the church, adding to its mystique.    Throughout history, St. Olaf's Church has undergone various transformations in its religious affiliation.

The opera company's performances take place at the Estonia Theatre, which has played a pivotal role in Estonian cultural history.  Established in 1870, the song and drama society Estonia laid the foundation for the development of the opera company. Over time, the theatre began staging song plays, folk plays, and comedies, eventually expanding its repertoire to include more serious dramas by the start of the 20th century.  In 1906, the Estonia society served as the basis for the establishment of the professional theatre called Estonia under the direction of Paul Pinna and Theodor Altermann. This marked a significant milestone in the development of the opera company, which remained associated with the Estonia society and the Estonian Theatre Estonia Limited Liability Company until 1940 when it was disbanded under Soviet rule and nationalized.

Alongside these architectural marvels, the square provides vistas of the city's church towers, adding to its grandeur.    The historical significance of Towers Square can be traced back to its connection with the Cistercian convent of St. Michael. Originally, it served as part of the convent's lands, but its purpose expanded over time. As the construction of the city's fortress wall commenced, the square became a venue for military parades. Simultaneously, townspeople utilized the area to graze their livestock, contributing to the square's vibrant atmosphere.    A significant turning point in the square's history occurred in 1896 when the territory was entrusted to the Estonian Society of Farming. This marked the establishment of Exhibition Grounds, which hosted a series of exhibitions, showcasing various aspects of Estonian culture and achievements. However, the era of exhibitions came to an end in 1930 when the pavilions built for this purpose were dismantled, leaving only one standing. The square then transitioned into a venue for movies and concerts, becoming a center of cultural gatherings. Tragically, a fire in 1933 engulfed the building, putting an end to this era.

Delving into the square's intriguing history, it's worth noting that Towers Square was once considered as a potential site for the construction of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in the late 19th century. However, this idea was abandoned due to the proximity of the noisy railway station.    Following World War II, the square underwent a transformation in nomenclature, being renamed Stalingradskaya square, which persisted from 1945 to 1961. During this period, it witnessed various changes and events that shaped the city's post-war landscape.    Another noteworthy aspect is the presence of the Mikhail Kalinin monument erected on the square in 1950. However, with changing times and shifting societal values, the monument was dismantled in 1990, marking a significant shift in the city's historical narrative.    In recent years, Towers Square has gained recognition as the host of the International Flower Festival during the summer months. This vibrant celebration of nature and beauty adorned the square with a colorful display of blossoms. However, in 2019, the festival did not take place due to a lack of participant interest, reflecting evolving trends and priorities.

The Fat Margaret Tower, also called Paks Margareeta, served as an artillery tower and played a vital role in the defense of the city. Its unique three-quarter circle shape, with a diameter of 25 meters, made it an impressive structure. The tower boasted thick walls, ranging from 2.25 to 5.5 meters, gradually decreasing in width towards the top. Its sturdy construction included strong wooden beam ceilings supported by a massive central stone post.    Throughout its existence, the Great Coastal Gate complex has witnessed several significant transformations. In the 19th century, Fat Margaret underwent a change in purpose and became a prison. Its imposing structure served as a deterrent for potential wrongdoers. In 1884, a four-floor limestone prison outbuilding was completed on the southern side of Fat Margaret, expanding the prison's capacity.    The complex suffered significant damage during the tumultuous events of the February Revolution in 1917. The prison was set ablaze, the prison warden was tragically killed, and the entire complex was left in ruins. However, in 1938-1940, extensive reconstruction efforts took place. The prison outbuilding and the barbican building were restored and repurposed as the City Museum premises. The walls of Fat Margaret were fixed and roofed, and the embrasures that had been repurposed as windows in the 19th century were restored to their original state.    In 1978-1981, the entire Great Coastal Gate complex underwent a comprehensive reconstruction to house the Estonian Maritime Museum. Reinforced concrete ceilings were added to Fat Margaret, the open platform floor was restored, and the artillery tower was given an exterior that closely resembled its original appearance.  The reconstruction and adaptation of the Coastal Gate and Fat Margaret tower complex were designed by Polish architect Jerzy Matusiak-Tusiacki in 1978-1979. The aim was to create a dedicated museum that would showcase Estonia's rich maritime history. Despite delays, the Estonian Maritime Museum officially opened its doors within the tower in 1981, offering visitors a captivating journey through Tallinn's seafaring past.    In 2018, the museum temporarily closed for renovations, focusing specifically on Fat Margaret. After an extensive restoration process, the new Fat Margaret Museum and Visitor Centre was unveiled in November 2019. Today, visitors can explore the museum's engaging exhibitions, which delve into Tallinn's maritime heritage, offering insights into navigation, trade, and the captivating stories behind the Great Coastal Gate and Fat Margaret Tower.    The Great Coastal Gate and Fat Margaret Tower stand as prominent cultural and historical landmarks in Tallinn. They symbolize the city's strategic importance, architectural prowess, and maritime legacy. As visitors wander through the complex, they are transported back in time, immersing themselves in the captivating tales of seafaring adventures, the defense of the harbor, and the enduring strength of Tallinn's fortifications. The Estonian Maritime Museum within Fat Margaret provides an enriching and educational experience, highlighting the maritime traditions that have shaped the region's identity over the centuries.",

In 1380, Wilhelm von Friemersheim, the Master of the Order, granted permission for the construction of a stone gate building. Over the centuries, the tower underwent several transformations and expansions, reflecting the evolving needs of Tallinn's defense system. In 1450, the tower was reconstructed, with additional protective floors and the installation of a staircase. This expansion likely increased the tower's height to approximately 20 meters, including an open defense floor. Notable payments were made to craftsmen during this period, including the blacksmith Rozenberg for gate devices and Claus Denen for crafting weather vanes in 1454 and 1455, respectively.    During the 16th and 17th centuries, Tallinn faced numerous challenges, prompting the fortification of its defenses. In 1594, a barrier was constructed in front of the Pika jala main gate, further enhancing the tower's defensive capabilities. In 1608, the top of the gate tower was rebuilt, contributing to its distinct architectural character.    Throughout the 19th century, the tower served various purposes, including being used as living quarters for soldiers stationed in Tallinn. However, in 1926, the tower underwent a significant transformation under the guidance of Ludvig Oskar Pika jala, an artist who embarked on the ambitious task of rebuilding the gate tower. Securing a bank loan of half a million marks, Pika jala demolished the old mantle chimney and made extensive renovations, including the installation of ovens and stoves on each floor. The Tallinn city government signed a lease agreement with Pika jala, initially for the years 1927-1939, but the term was later extended at his request.    For several years, Pika jala resided in the Long Leg Gate Tower, utilizing the space not only as living quarters but also as studios for artistic endeavors. However, his time in the tower came to an end when he fled to Germany in 1944 amidst the turmoil of World War II.    Following a devastating fire in 1995, the tower underwent a comprehensive restoration, including the addition of a new spire. The restoration efforts aimed to preserve the tower's historical significance and architectural integrity. Notably, the weather vane adorning the tower was forged by renowned metal artist Heino Müller, whose studio was once located within its walls.    Today, the Long Leg Gate Tower stands as a testament to Tallinn's rich history and vibrant artistic community. The tower serves as a unique living space and artistic hub, providing a glimpse into the city's cultural heritage. Visitors can marvel at its trapezoidal design, soak in the echoes of the past, and appreciate the creative energy that resonates within its restored walls. The Long Leg Gate Tower stands as a cherished piece of Tallinn's architectural heritage, connecting the city's past with its present.",

  "Medium": "Pikk Hermann, also referred to as Tall Hermann or Langer Hermann, is an iconic tower situated within the confines of Toompea Castle on Toompea hill in Tallinn, Estonia.

The tower boasts ten internal floors and a captivating viewing platform accessible via a 215-step staircase. Located adjacent to the Estonian Parliament building, Pikk Hermann serves as a powerful symbol of the government in force. At 95 meters (312 ft) above sea level, the flag atop the tower proudly displays the blue-black-white colors of Estonia. This symbolic gesture has deep historical significance, with the original flag being raised on Pikk Hermann for the first time on December 12, 1918, following Estonia's independence. However, during the Soviet occupation, the flag was removed and replaced with the flag of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was only on February 24, 1989, that the original flag was raised back on Pikk Hermann, reinstating the tower's symbolic role. To this day, the Estonian flag is ceremoniously raised and lowered on Pikk Hermann, accompanied by the national anthem and the song Mu isamaa on minu arm (My Fatherland is My Love). This tradition takes place during sunrise and sunset, respecting specific time constraints. Notably, during Otto Tief's brief interim government from September 18 to 22, 1944, the Estonian flag was also temporarily raised over Pikk Hermann, representing a significant moment in the nation's history.",

At 95 meters (312 ft) above sea level, the flag flying atop Pikk Hermann holds a special place in Estonia's symbolism. The blue-black-white colors represent the nation's identity and independence. The tradition of raising the Estonian flag on Pikk Hermann dates back to December 12, 1918, when the original flag was hoisted to commemorate Estonia's newfound independence. However, during the dark days of Soviet occupation, the flag was forcibly removed and replaced with the flag of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was not until February 24, 1989, that the original blue-black-white flag was reinstated on Pikk Hermann, reclaiming its symbolic significance. The flag-raising ceremony on Pikk Hermann is a cherished tradition observed during Estonia's Independence Day. At sunrise, the national flag, measuring 191 centimeters (75 in) by 300 centimeters (120 in), is ceremoniously raised to the top of the tower. The national anthem fills the air, followed by the resonant melody of Mu isamaa on minu arm (My Fatherland is My Love) as the flag is lowered during sunset. This poignant ritual pays tribute to the nation's heritage, resilience, and unity. Beyond its role as a venerated symbol, Pikk Hermann holds historical significance as well. During Otto Tief's brief interim government from September 18 to 22, 1944, the Estonian flag was once again unfurled atop the tower, serving as a symbol of resistance and hope during a turbulent time.

  "Medium": "Maarjamae Palace, located in Tallinn, Estonia, has a fascinating history that reflects the changing times and uses of the site. Originally called Strietberg, it was a sought-after spot for summer leisure activities. In the late 17th century, a small summer manor was established there by Christian von Geldern, a councillor and member of the Brotherhood of Blackheads. Over the years, the site underwent various transformations. In 1811, a sugar factory was built on the premises by Johan Gottlieb Clementz, giving rise to the local name  Suhkrumägi  (Sugar Hill). By the 1820s, Tallinn had become a renowned beach resort, attracting visitors to the area. In 1861, Christian Abraham Rotermann, a councillor and entrepreneur, acquired the site and repurposed it as a starch and spirit factory. However, a devastating fire in 1869 brought an end to the factory operations. In 1873, the property changed hands once again, this time purchased by Count Anatoli Orlov-Davydov. He named the place Marienberg, later known as Maarjamäe, after his wife, Maria. Over time, the Orlov-Davydov family emigrated, and the summer manor was leased. In 1933, Maarjamäe Palace took on a new role as the grand opening of the Riviera-Palais restaurant-hotel attracted attention. With its elegant atmosphere and scenic surroundings, it became a popular destination for grand receptions and festive events. However, in 1937, the palace was purchased by the government, leading to its transformation into the Military Aviation School of the Republic of Estonia.

Originally known as Strietberg, it served as a popular summer retreat where people sought respite during the warm months. In the late 17th century, Christian von Geldern, a councillor and member of the Brotherhood of Blackheads, established a small summer manor on the site. In 1811, Johan Gottlieb Clementz, a merchant, purchased a plot of land at Strietberg and erected a sugar factory, leading locals to refer to the area as Suhkrumägi (Sugar Hill). By 1820, in addition to the factory building, there were eleven other stone structures, a wooden dwelling, sheds, a smithy, a lime kiln, an arched ice cellar, and a pool with canals used to direct water to the factory. The area was enclosed by a limestone wall standing over 4 meters high, and several of the stone buildings, the ice cellar, and parts of the perimeter wall have been preserved. In 1861, Christian Abraham Rotermann, a councillor and founder of a storeyard, acquired the sugar factory. He converted the premises into a starch and spirit factory, making significant contributions to Tallinn's industrial landscape. However, a devastating fire in 1869 destroyed the factory, leading Rotermann to cease operations at Strietberg. By the 1820s, Tallinn had gained renown as a beach resort, attracting visitors from near and far. On January 29, 1873, Count Anatoli Orlov-Davydov, a resident of St. Petersburg, acquired the Strietberg property and its buildings from Rotermann's heirs. The count named the place Marienberg, possibly in honor of his wife, Maria. The Estonian version of the name, Maarjamäe, gained popularity in the late 1930s. With the Orlov-Davydov family's emigration following the 1917 revolution, the summer manor was leased to various occupants. In 1933, Maarjamäe Palace underwent another transformation when it became the Riviera-Palais, an elegant restaurant-hotel that quickly became a renowned venue for grand receptions, literary and musical events, and Midsummer's Eve celebrations. Warm fireplaces, an illuminated glass dance floor, and scenic surroundings added to its allure. However, in 1937, the palace was acquired by the government, leading to its conversion into the Military Aviation School of the Republic of Estonia. The school welcomed its first students on November 1, 1937, and its mission was to train military pilots, reconnaissance pilots, and aircraft technicians. Reconstruction works were carried out, including the demolition of the veranda and balcony, altering the façade's appearance. In 1940, Maarjamäe Palace came under the control of the Soviet Army. After the army vacated the premises, the palace was filled with apartments and communal kitchens. The once-neat and tidy area fell into disrepair and ruins. In the 1980s, restoration efforts took place to revive the palace and its historical significance. Restorers from the Wroclav department of the Polish company PKZ worked on the first stage of the palace complex from 1983 to 1988. The external appearance of the buildings, including the grand staircase, was meticulously restored based on old photographs and drawings. However, the interior was reconfigured to accommodate the needs of the museum. An annex was also constructed, featuring a two-story cinema hall adorned with bronze sculptures by Ants Mölder. Evald Okas created a mural titled  Friendship of Nations  in 1987 for the former summer hall of the palace, aligning with the prevailing zeitgeist. The palace connected to a Classicist auxiliary building from the first half of the 19th century, which now served as workrooms. In late 1987, the History and Revolution Museum of the Estonian SSR opened in the palace, presenting Estonian history from the mid-19th century to the modern era. It was the last permanent exhibition in Estonia subject to direct orders from the ideologists of the Estonian Communist Party's Central Committee. Following the restoration of Estonia's independence, the permanent exhibition was updated to reflect the country's new era. The auxiliary buildings on the slopes of Maarjamäe were renovated and repurposed as museum depositories. The entire area continues to undergo general cleaning and landscaping. In 2008, the first-floor permanent exhibition was further updated, coinciding with the opening of the grand exhibition  Will to be free. 90 Years of the Republic of Estonia  commemorating the nation's 90th anniversary. On the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Estonia, Maarjamäe Palace, as part of the Estonian History Museum, was unveiled as a history discovery center. The palace underwent renovations, and the Estonian Film Museum found its home in the surrounding park. Visitors can explore the exhibition  My Free Country,  which unfolds over 100 years, offering insights into Estonia's past and fostering discussions about its future. Additionally, children can engage in building their own country within the enjoyable Children's Republic. Maarjamäe Palace stands as a testament to Estonia's rich history and cultural heritage.

  "Long": "Nestled at the southern end of Tallinn's Old Town, Freedom Square (Vabaduse väljak) resonates with historical significance and symbolic weight. Designed by architects Tiit Trummal, Veljo Kaasik, and Andres Alver, the square has evolved from a humble parking lot to a dynamic plaza, fostering a sense of unity and collective identity. The square encompasses an expansive area of 7,752 m2, stretching approximately 110 meters by 75 meters. Its location is framed by notable landmarks, including St. John's Church, Kaarli Boulevard, and a remarkable Victory Column dedicated to the Estonian War of Independence (1918-1920). This column stands tall, embodying the enduring spirit and resilience of a nation. The history of Freedom Square intertwines with Tallinn's rich past. It rose on the grounds of the former Swedish bastion, which was dismantled in the mid-19th century. In 1867, St. John's Church emerged as a symbol of spiritual devotion and architectural grandeur, anchoring the square's eastern boundary. Subsequent developments, such as the transformation of the Haymarket into paved stones in 1910, marked the evolving character of the square. Amidst the seismic shifts of occupation, the square experienced a succession of name changes, each reflecting the prevailing political climate. From Victory Square to Freedom Square and back to Victory Square, the nomenclature mirrored Estonia's quest for independence and the challenging times that followed. Parades and celebrations commemorating Soviet holidays reverberated within its open space, bearing witness to the complex historical narratives etched into the nation's collective memory. A defining moment in the square's history unfolded on June 23, 2009, when the Cross of Liberty and the Monument to the War of Independence (Vabadussõja võidusammas) were unveiled.

Crafted as a memorial for the fallen heroes of the Estonian War of Independence, the Cross of Liberty and the Monument to the War of Independence holds profound historical significance. The idea of establishing such a monument emerged in 1919, during the war itself, but its realization was delayed by the outbreak of the Second World War and subsequent Soviet occupation. However, with Estonia's regained independence in 1991, the vision of a national monument resurfaced. In 2005, the decision to erect a Column of Victory at Freedom Square was made by the Riigikogu, Estonia's parliament. A design competition ensued, attracting over 40 entries. The winning design, titled  Libertas,  was created by Rainer Sternfeld, Andri Laidre, Kadri Kiho, and Anto Savi, capturing the spirit of freedom and resilience. The Cross of Liberty and the Monument to the War of Independence were unveiled on June 23, 2009, amid a profound sense of national pride and remembrance.

  "Long": "The Danish King's Garden, located in Tallinn's Old Town west of Rüütli Street, holds a significant place in the city's history and folklore. The garden derives its name from King Valdemar II, whose victorious campaign in 1219 established Danish rule in Tallinn and Northern Estonia for over a hundred years. According to legend, the Danes obtained their national flag, Dannebrog, at the very spot where the garden now stands. During a battle on the slopes of Toompea Hill, the Estonian malev (militia) attacked the Danish camp. In his desperate prayer for divine assistance, King Valdemar witnessed a miraculous event as a red flag with a white cross descended from the sky. Inspired by this celestial intervention, the Danish forces were able to repel their opponents and secure victory. In the 14th century, the garden earned its name   Garden of the Danish King   due to the gratitude of Tallinn's citizens. This recognition came in response to King Erik Menved's resolution of a dispute that arose during the planning of the Tallinn city wall. The king confirmed the construction line of the city wall, protecting Toompea and the lower city, thereby granting the merchants and craftsmen of Tallinn's sub-city the right to continue their activities in the area. This privilege bestowed upon the city-state the enduring right to utilize the slope of Toompea Mountain, ensuring that   no one was ever allowed to prevent or disturb   the people of Tallinn from exercising their freedom within this territory. The Danish King's Garden serves as a tranquil oasis within the historic Old Town. Amidst its verdant surroundings, the garden features a stone memorial plaque dedicated to the esteemed artists Paul and Kristjan Raua. Their contribution to the cultural heritage of Tallinn is commemorated in this serene setting. Visitors can appreciate the picturesque landscape while contemplating the city's rich artistic traditions.

This special day commemorates the Danish flag, symbolizing the enduring ties between the two nations. It is an occasion for reflection and appreciation of the shared history and cultural exchange between Denmark and Estonia.

The current building, a remarkable example of Renaissance Revival architecture, was designed by the renowned architect Georg Winterhalter and constructed between 1845 and 1848. In the aftermath of Estonia's independence in 1920, the Knighthood House witnessed a transformation as it became the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, symbolizing the nation's pursuit of diplomatic endeavors on the international stage.

  "Long": "Nestled within the enchanting Toompea district of Tallinn, the Estonian Knighthood House stands as an architectural gem with a compelling historical narrative. Since the 13th century, when Estonia was under the rule of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, German nobles assumed positions of power and influence in the region. As these nobles united under the Estonian Knighthood, the Knighthood House became their cherished gathering place, where celebrations and meetings were held and their esteemed peerage register was meticulously maintained. The current iteration of the Knighthood House, an exquisite embodiment of Renaissance Revival style, emerged through the vision of architect Georg Winterhalter and the craftsmanship of skilled builders between 1845 and 1848. It replaced its predecessors, which were lost to fires or outgrown by the burgeoning needs of the Knighthood. The winds of change swept through Estonia in 1920, as the nation gained independence and the privileges of the German Knights were revoked. The Knighthood House found a new purpose as it became Estonia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, symbolizing the country's diplomatic aspirations on the global stage. However, the course of history took another turn with the Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940. The nation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs ceased to exist, and the Knighthood House underwent a transformation yet again. From 1948 to 1992, it served as the National Library of Estonia, preserving and disseminating knowledge to generations of eager minds. During this time, the building became a sanctuary of learning, nurturing intellectual curiosity and fostering a sense of cultural heritage.

This infusion of artistic expression breathed new life into the building's storied halls, providing a space for contemplation and appreciation of Estonia's creative legacy. As the years unfolded, the art collection found its way back to Kadriorg Palace, where it could be fully showcased and celebrated.

One of the most significant expansions was the construction of the Louvre Pyramid, which was designed by the architect I.M. Pei and opened to the public in 1989. The pyramid is made of glass and steel and serves as the main entrance to the museum. A fact you may not know about the louvre is that it was the site of a heist. In 1911, long before all of the cameras and sensors, the Mona Lisa was stolen. In the dead of night, an Italian security guard locked himself in a storage cupboard so he wouldn’t have to leave the Louvre at the end of his shift.He waited until everyone had left the museum and stuffed the masterpiece into his jacket. When the museum opened the following morning, he simply walked out- with the masterpiece in tow. The theft wasn’t discovered until a day or two later… And this is why the Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece is the most famous of all da Vinci’s works!nIn addition to its vast art collection, the Louvre Museum is also known for its fascinating history and folklore. Legend has it that the Louvre is haunted by a mummy called Belphegor. This myth even spurred a French television series and film.n",

  "Long": "Welcome to the French Comedy Theatre, a historic theatre in Paris that has been entertaining audiences for over 300 years. The theatre, also known as the Comédie-Française is one of the oldest and most prestigious theatre companies in the world. Founded in 1680 by Louis XIV, the French Comedy Theatre has a rich history and tradition of producing high-quality plays and performances.nnThe theatre's origins can be traced back to the merging of two theatre companies, the Théâtre de Guénégaud and the Théâtre du Marais. The merger was ordered by Louis XIV himself, who wanted to create a national theatre company that would showcase French culture and promote the French language. The French Comedy Theatre became the official theatre of the French monarchy and has since then been closely associated with French royalty and culture. The theater has three venues: the Salle Richelieu, the Studio-Théâtre, and the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier.nnThe theatre has also been known as the Théâtre de la République and popularly as La Maison de Molière (The House of Molière). It acquired the latter name from the troupe of the best-known playwright associated with the Comédie-Française, Molière.  He was considered the patron of French actors and is widely regarded as one of the greatest writers in the French language and world literature. nnOver the centuries, the French Comedy Theatre has hosted many of France's greatest playwrights, actors, and directors. Famous playwrights such as Molière, Racine, and Marivaux had their works performed on the theatre's stage, while legendary actors such as Sarah Bernhardt, Jean-Louis Barrault, and Gérard Depardieu have graced its boards. Today, the theatre continues to produce a diverse range of plays, from classic French works to contemporary productions.nnThe French Comedy Theatre is located in the Palais-Royal complex, in the heart of Paris. The theatre's beautiful facade is adorned with classical sculptures and is an architectural marvel in itself. The theatre's interior is just as grand, with its ornate decorations, velvet seats, and majestic chandeliers.nnThe French Comedy Theatre offers guided tours of the theatre, which provide a fascinating glimpse into the theatre's history, architecture, and inner workings.

The building is an impressive example of neoclassical architecture and features a rectangular design with a giant Corinthian colonnade enclosing a vaulted and arcaded central chamber. The building's initial designs were greatly admired by Napoleon and won Brongniart a major public commission at the end of his career. However, the authorities required Brongniart to modify his designs, and after Brongniart's death in 1813, Éloi Labarre altered them even further, greatly weakening Brongniart's original intentions. From 1901 to 1905, two lateral wings were added by Jean-Baptiste-Frederic Cavel, resulting in a cruciform plan with innumerable columns. Despite these alterations, the Palais Brongniart remains an important historical building and hosts cultural events and exhibitions today.nnTourists visiting Paris can appreciate the building's stunning neoclassical design and explore its history as the city's former stock exchange. The Palais Brongniart also hosts a variety of cultural events, including art exhibitions, conferences, and performances. Visitors can check the building's schedule for upcoming events and purchase tickets online. Additionally, the building's central location in the II arrondissement makes it easily accessible to tourists exploring the surrounding areas. Tourists can also learn more about the history of Paris's financial district and its role in shaping the city's development by visiting nearby landmarks such as the Banque de France and the Opéra Garnier.",

Leopold executed the sculptural segments, while Charles executed the architectural segments. The monument was chosen as part of an art competition announced in early 1879 by the Paris City Council, which sought to create a Monument to the French Republic in honor of the 90th anniversary of the French Revolution, to be erected on the Place de la République. The Morice statue was chosen by the jury, but a vociferous minority opinion among jury members claimed precedence for the second prize, the submission of Jules Dalou, who had just returned from exile in England. Dalou's statue, which was completely different in style, impressed the jury so much that it was decided in early 1880 to erect his monument to the Republic on the",

The canal connects the Canal de l'Ourcq to the river Seine and was constructed in response to the threat of diseases like dysentery and cholera. Napoleon I ordered the construction of the canal in 1802, and it was completed in 1825 with funding from a new tax on wine. The canal was also used to transport grain, building materials, and other goods on canal boats. Ports were created on the canal in Paris to unload the boats: Port de l'Arsenal and the Bassin de la Villette.nnIn the mid-19th century, nearly half of the canal's length was covered to create boulevards and public spaces. However, the canal remains a fascinating subject for Parisians, who enjoy exploring the hundreds of tons of discarded objects that are found when the canal is drained and cleaned every 10-15 years. The canal narrowly escaped being filled in and paved over for a highway in the 1960s.nnToday, the Canal Saint-Martin is a popular destination for Parisians and tourists. Passengers can take cruises on the canal, enjoying the sight of barges and other boats navigating the locks and passing under cast-iron footbridges.

The canal is entered from the vast terminal basin (Bassin de la Villette) of the Canal de l'Ourcq, and it is bordered by the Quai de Valmy on the right bank and the Quai de Jemmapes on the left. The canal passes through three double staircase locks before disappearing under three successive voûtes (tunnels) – du Temple, Richard-Lenoir, and Bastille – to emerge in the Port de l'Arsenal, the principal port for boats visiting and residing in Paris.",

The mahJ has a wide range of works from famous artists such as Marc Chagall and Amedeo Modigliani. The museum's mission is to promote the contributions of Jews to France and to the world, especially in the arts.nnThe mahJ offers a comprehensive visitor experience, including a bookshop selling books on Jewish art and history and Judaica, a media library with an online catalogue accessible to the public, and an auditorium which hosts conferences, lectures, concerts, performances, and seminars. The museum also provides guided weekly visits in English during the tourist season (April–July) for individuals as well as students and teachers, and workshops for children, families, and adults.

  "Long": "The Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme (mahJ), also known as the Museum of Jewish Art and History, is the largest museum of Jewish art and history in France. The museum is situated in the Marais district in Paris and is housed in the historic Hôtel de Saint-Aignan. The mahJ was created in 1985 by Claude-Gérard Marcus, Victor Klagsbald, and Alain Erlande-Brandenburg with the goal of providing Paris with an ambitious museum dedicated to Judaism and presenting national collections acquired from the reserves of the national museum of the Middle Ages. At the time, only a modest museum devoted to Judaism existed in Paris on the rue des Saules.nnThe project was backed by the City of Paris and the ministry of Culture, represented by Jack Lang, Minister of Culture. The museum was inaugurated in 1998 after being led by Laurence Sigal, who oversaw the redesign of the interior of the building. The decision to set up the museum in the Marais was a conscious one. Since the end of the 18th century, a large population of Jews has lived in the Marais. Today, the Marais has been transformed into a trendy neighborhood, but it remains a cultural center for museums such as the musée Carnavalet, the musée Picasso, and the Mémorial de la Shoah (Memorial for the Holocaust).nnThe mahJ's permanent collection was assembled from three main sources. The first is the Musée d’art juif de Paris, whose collection was given to the mahJ. It consisted mainly of European religious objects, graphic works by Russian and German Jewish artists and artists from the School of Paris, and architectural models of European synagogues destroyed by the Nazis. The second source is the Musée national du Moyen-Age in Paris,",

In 1572, the hôtel was purchased by Madame de Kernevenoy, the widow of a member of the Court of Henry II of France, and the preceptor of the Duke of Anjou, who became Henry III of France. During this period, the facade and portals were given lavish decoration of Renaissance sculpture, much of which still can be seen. They were the work of the sculptor Jean Goujon and his workshop.nnThe Hôtel Le Peletier de Saint Fargeau was annexed to the Carnavalet in 1989 to commemorate the bicentennial of the French Revolution.

In 1605, King Henry IV and his successor Louis XIII began construction on the north wing, which was completed in 1628. Together, these two wings formed the building that we know today as the Hôtel de Ville.nnThe building has played a significant role in many historical events throughout its history. During the French Revolution, the building served as the headquarters of the revolutionaries, and in 1870, it was the site of the proclamation of the French Third Republic. However, the Hôtel de Ville is perhaps best known for its destruction during the Paris Commune in 1871. The building was burned down along with all the city archives that it contained, leading to the loss of many valuable historical records.nnThe Hôtel de Ville was rebuilt between 1874 and 1882, following the original design but with some modifications to the interior. The reconstruction was directed by architects Théodore Ballu and Édouard Deperthes, who won the public competition for the building's reconstruction. While the rebuilt Hôtel de Ville from the outside appears to be a copy of the 16th-century French Renaissance building that stood before 1871, the new interior was based on an entirely new design, with ceremonial rooms lavishly decorated in the 1880s style.nnToday, the Hôtel de Ville serves multiple functions, housing the local government council, the Mayors of Paris and their cabinets, and also serves as a venue for large receptions. It remains one of the most recognizable landmarks in Paris and is a testament to the city's rich history and cultural heritage.",

A relic of the saint preserved in the church linked it more strongly to the pilgrimage routes and in modern times occasioned its listing among the sites and structures marking the chemins de Compostelle.nnThe church, with the exception of the tower, was demolished in 1793, and preservation of the tower was a condition of the contract by which the church was bought for the value of its building materials. In 1824, the tower was being used as a shot tower to make small shot. It was repurchased by the City of Paris in 1836 and declared a Monument Historique in 1862. During the Second Empire, the architect Théodore Ballu restored the tower, placing it on a pedestal and designing a small city park around it. This coincided with the construction of the rue de Rivoli and the avenue Victoria nearby, requiring huge quantities of earth to be removed to ensure the rue de Rivoli a smooth flat path. The pedestal allowed the tower to retain its original elevation: nowadays, the change in ground level can best be appreciated in rue St-Bon, just northeast of the tower, where a staircase leads up to the original street level at rue de la Verrerie.nnToday, the Tour Saint-Jacques is considered a national historic landmark and listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.",

In 1977, the museum's Renaissance art collections were transferred to the newly created Musée National de la Renaissance at the Château d'Écouen in the northern outskirts of Paris, freeing additional space for medieval artworks. In 2011, a comprehensive renovation project, known as Cluny 4, was initiated by the French culture ministry, which included a redesign of the Lady and the Unicorn display in 2013 and the chronologically reorganized display of medieval art collections from 2019 to 2022.",

The center of the attic level was decorated with geometric motifs in colored marble, replaced in 1862 with a bas-relief of scrolls and children. The fountain was inaugurated in 1860, featuring a statue of the Archangel Michael wrestling with the devil in the central niche.nnIn 1870, during the French-German War, the fountain was threatened by a mob and appeared to have been damaged during the 1871 Paris Commune. The fountain was repaired in 1872 and again in 1893. The imperial arms which originally decorated the fountain's pediment were replaced by those of the City of Paris.

  "Long": "Saint-Étienne-du-Mont is a church located on the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève in Paris, France, in the 5th arrondissement, near the Panthéon. Originally dedicated to St. Etienne, the church was constructed in 1222, when the Pope authorized the establishment of an autonomous church to serve the nearby College of Sorbonne. The church is famous for its shrine to St. Geneviève, the patron saint of Paris, and for the tombs of Blaise Pascal and Jean Racine.nnThe church was built adjacent to the Abbey of Sainte-Genevieve, founded in 502, and the two buildings were connected. During the Gallo-Roman era, the Parisii tribe of Lutetia gradually settled a hill on the left bank of the Seine, called Mount Lucotecius. In the 6th century, Clovis, the King of the Franks, built a basilica at the top of the hill, dedicated to the Apostles Peter and Paul. Clovis was buried there, along with his wife Clotilde, and several kings of the Merovingian dynasty.nnThe construction of the present-day church began in the late 15th century and continued through the 16th century in the flamboyant Gothic style. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the church of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont enjoyed great prestige. The remains of a number of prominent scientists and artists were interred there, including Pierre Perrault, the painter Eustache Le Sueur, and Blaise Pascal. Those of Racine were transferred in 1711 from Port-Royal to Saint-Etienne. In 1744, King Louis XV decided to replace the nearby abbey with an even larger church, which eventually became the Paris Panthéon.nnDuring the French Revolution, the church was closed and turned into a Temple of Filial Piety. The sculpture, decoration, and stained glass suffered extensive damage, and many church treasures and relics disappeared. Catholic worship was finally restored in 1803, under the Concordat of 1801. Under the Second Empire of Napoleon III, the church was extensively restored by the Paris city architect Victor Baltard between 1865 and 1868. The facade was restored and increased in height, and sculpture and stained glass that were destroyed during the Revolution were replaced.",

Rambuteau built 200 kilometers of new water mains and 1700 small fountains to supply water, which allowed monumental fountains to be purely decorative rather than sources of drinking water.nnThe Fontaine Saint-Sulpice was designed with a religious theme in mind, as it was placed in front of a church and near an important seminary.

The second basin was decorated with sculptures of lions made of stone from Derre, which had the coat of arms of Paris, and the third had pots which spouted water.

Initially conceived as a home and hospital for disabled soldiers, it has evolved into a multifaceted complex celebrating France's military history. Nestled in the 7th arrondissement, this iconic landmark encompasses several museums, monuments, and facilities dedicated to preserving the nation's military heritage.nnAmong the notable attractions housed within Les Invalides is the Musée de l'Armée, a comprehensive military museum showcasing an extensive collection of artifacts, weaponry, uniforms, and artworks. It provides visitors with insights into the rich military history of France, spanning from ancient times to the modern era. The Musée des Plans-Reliefs offers intricate models and relief maps that illustrate fortified cities and strategic battlefields. Additionally, the Musée d'Histoire Contemporaine delves into the complexities of contemporary military history, exploring significant events and their impact on society.nnAt the heart of Les Invalides stands the magnificent Dôme des Invalides, a grand dome structure that reaches an impressive height of 107 meters. Designed in the Baroque architectural style, it serves as a remarkable symbol of France's absolute monarchy. The interior of the dome features breathtaking paintings by Charles de La Fosse, depicting intricate scenes from French military history. The Dôme des Invalides is also home to the tomb of one of France's most iconic figures, Napoleon Bonaparte. This monumental tomb, designed by Louis Visconti, pays tribute to the legendary military leader and emperor of France. The red quartzite sarcophagus rests on a green granite base, creating a striking centerpiece within the dome.nnThe history of Les Invalides is intertwined with significant moments in French history. In 1789, during the French Revolution, the complex was seized by Parisian rioters who acquired cannons and muskets stored within its cellars. This act marked a pivotal moment in the revolutionary fervor that led to the storming of the Bastille later that same day.nnAnother significant event took place in 1840 when Napoleon's remains were transferred from Saint Helena to Les Invalides in a grand ceremony known as le retour des cendres (the return of the ashes). The crypt beneath the Dôme des Invalides became the final resting place for Napoleon Bonaparte, solidifying the complex as a military necropolis.nnOver the years, Les Invalides has continued to evolve and adapt. It once served as a retirement home and hospital for war veterans, providing them with care and support. In the late 19th century, the complex underwent transformations to accommodate the Musée d'Artillerie and the Musée Historique des Armées, which eventually merged to form the present-day Musée de l'Armée in 1905.nnToday, Les Invalides remains a symbol of France's military prowess and heritage. It houses the Cathédrale Saint-Louis-des-Invalides, serving as the spiritual center for the French armed forces. The complex also includes a retirement home, a medical and surgical center, and facilities for external medical consultations, ensuring the well-being of military veterans.nnWith its awe-inspiring architecture, rich historical significance, and diverse range of museums and exhibits, Les Invalides stands as a testament to France's military legacy. It offers visitors a unique opportunity to explore the nation's military history, pay homage to legendary figures, and gain a deeper understanding of the profound impact of war on society. Whether admiring the grandeur of the Dôme des Invalides, exploring the extensive collections of the Musée de l'Armée, or reflecting in the presence of Napoleon's tomb, a visit to Les Invalides is a captivating journey through France's military past.",

With its vast array of artwork, the Musée Rodin attracts approximately 700,000 visitors each year, making it a popular destination for art enthusiasts from around the world.",
  "Medium": "At the Musée Rodin, visitors can explore the exceptional sculptures and artistic legacy of Auguste Rodin. During his residency at the Villa des Brillants in Meudon, Rodin utilized the Hôtel Biron as his workshop, eventually donating his entire collection of sculptures to the French State. This generous act, accompanied by the condition that the buildings be transformed into a museum dedicated to his works, led to the establishment of the Musée Rodin. The museum proudly showcases many of Rodin's significant creations, including iconic pieces like The Thinker, The Kiss, and The Gates of Hell. The extensive garden surrounding the museum is adorned with numerous sculptures, providing visitors with the opportunity to appreciate Rodin's artistry in a natural setting.nnThe Musée Rodin also features a room dedicated to the works of Camille Claudel, a talented sculptor and collaborator of Rodin.

These photographs offer a unique glimpse into Rodin's artistic process and personal life, providing valuable insights into his studio and the period between 1877 and his death in 1917.",
  "Long": "The Musée Rodin boasts two notable locations: the Hôtel Biron in Paris and the Villa des Brillants in Meudon. The Hôtel Biron, a magnificent mansion built between 1727 and 1732, serves as the primary site of the museum. The building, adorned with classical architectural elements and rocaille decoration, opened its doors to the public as the Musée Rodin on August 4, 1919. Over the years, the Hôtel Biron has welcomed esteemed artists and thinkers, including Jean Cocteau, Henri Matisse, Isadora Duncan, and Rainer Maria Rilke. It was Rilke's future wife, Clara Westhoff, who first informed Rodin about the property. Initially, Rodin rented four ground-floor rooms for his studios in 1908, gradually occupying the entire building by 1911. During this period, Rodin engaged in negotiations with the French state, officially announcing his intention to donate his works, drawings, and collection of antiquities on the condition that they be housed at the Hôtel Biron and remain his residence for life.nnIn 1916, a law was passed, granting the French state the authority to accept Rodin's donations and allocate the Hôtel Biron and its grounds to become a museum. Léonce Bénédite was appointed as the executor of Rodin's will and entrusted with managing the artist's heritage and organizing the future museum.nnDesignated as a historical monument in 1926, the Hôtel Biron and its grounds have undergone significant restoration and renovation work to enhance their role as a museum. The most recent restoration project, completed on Rodin's 175th birthday on November 12, 2015, cost 16 million euros and was celebrated as a moral duty by France's Culture Minister.nnThe Hôtel Biron is a testament to classical architecture and rocaille decoration, providing a fitting backdrop for Rodin's sculptures. The museum's collection includes his renowned works, such as The Thinker, The Kiss, and The Gates of Hell. Visitors can also explore the extensive garden surrounding the museum, where many of Rodin's sculptures are displayed in natural settings. The picturesque garden features a small lake and a casual restaurant, offering a tranquil environment for art appreciation.nnBeyond the Hôtel Biron, the Musée Rodin extends its presence to the Villa des Brillants in Meudon. Acquired by Rodin in 1895, this Louis XIII-style house served as his residence and a hub for his creative endeavors. Rodin employed a team of assistants, workers, and casters at the villa, and it became a gathering place for friends, admirers, and prominent figures. After Rodin's passing, the villa and studio were transformed into a museum, allowing visitors to experience the ambiance of his working environment. The museum in Meudon exhibits numerous plasters, including casts for monumental works like The Burghers of Calais and The Gates of Hell, providing insights into Rodin's artistic process and the evolution of his creations.nnIn addition to its permanent collections, the Musée Rodin hosts temporary exhibitions dedicated to Rodin himself. These exhibitions explore various aspects of his artistic career, including his approach to sculpture and his influences. The museum has also embraced contemporary art, featuring exhibitions by artists like Anthony Caro, Eugène Dodeigne, Étienne Bossut, and Wim Delvoye.nnThe Musée Rodin is easily accessible via public transportation, with the nearby Métro stop, Varenne, showcasing some of Rodin's sculptures on the platform. The museum's central location in Paris, along with its exceptional collection and beautiful surroundings, continue to attract art enthusiasts and visitors from around the world.",

As your tour guide, I will take you on a journey through this iconic location, sharing fascinating facts and information that will enhance your experience as a visitor.nnThe Champ de Mars, also known as the Field of Mars, is located in the enchanting seventh arrondissement of Paris. It stretches between two famous landmarks: the magnificent Eiffel Tower to the northwest and the prestigious École Militaire to the southeast. Its name pays tribute to the Campus Martius in Rome, dedicated to the Roman god of war, and reflects its historical association with military drills and parades.nnOriginally, this vast green space was part of Grenelle, an area reserved for market gardening. Local citizens cultivated small plots to grow fruits, vegetables, and flowers for the local market. However, the soil here proved to be less fertile for farming.nnThe transformation of the Champ de Mars began in 1765 with the construction of the École Militaire, a magnificent military school designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Originally, the grounds for military drills were planned to the south of the school, but the decision was made to create an esplanade to the north instead. This led to the construction of the noble facade that now encloses the Champ de Mars. The grounds were leveled, a large ditch was added, and a beautiful avenue of elms was planted. To create a visually pleasing perspective, the Isle of Swans, a riverine islet, was incorporated into the park.nnThe Champ de Mars has witnessed several significant events throughout history. On July 14, 1790, the first Federation Day celebration, now known as Bastille Day, took place here, marking the one-year anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. However, the park also witnessed tragic moments, such as the massacre on the Champ de Mars on July 17, 1791, during the French Revolution.nnDuring the French Revolution, the Champ de Mars became a site of grand festivals. One notable event was the Festival of the Supreme Being on June 8, 1794. The painter Jacques-Louis David designed an impressive Altar of the Nation atop an artificial mountain, adorned with a symbolic tree of liberty. This festival is considered one of the most successful of its kind during the Revolution.nnThe Champ de Mars has not only played a historical role but has also hosted significant cultural events. In 2012, it was the site of the United Buddy Bears exhibit, featuring over 140 two-meter-tall bear sculptures representing different countries. These bears promote values such as peace, love, tolerance, and international understanding.nnFor film enthusiasts, the Champ de Mars may seem familiar as it served as a filming location for the 1985 James Bond film A View to a Kill. In this thrilling movie, James Bond, played by Roger Moore, embarked on an exciting chase through the streets of Paris, including a scene where he drives a hijacked taxi along the Champ de Mars.nnSports enthusiasts will also find activities to enjoy at the Champ de Mars. The park features a basketball court and a football field, providing opportunities for friendly matches and recreational games. Moreover, the Champ de Mars will be an essential venue during the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, hosting beach volleyball and five-a-side football competitions.",

This architectural marvel, inspired by London's Crystal Palace, was one of the last transparent structures built before the age of electricity.nnOver the years, the Grand Palais has evolved, adapting to the needs of each era. While originally connected along an east-west axis by a grand staircase, the interior layout has been modified to accommodate various exhibitions and events. The main purpose of the Grand Palais has always been to celebrate French art, as highlighted by the pediment's inscription: a monument dedicated by the Republic to the glory of French art.nnHowever, the Grand Palais has faced its share of challenges.

This convergence resulted in the disappearance of the Passage de l'Opéra, a location immortalized by Louis Aragon in his novel Le Paysan de Paris.nnThroughout its history, Boulevard Haussmann has been linked to notable individuals and cultural milestones. From 1906 to 1919, the acclaimed novelist Marcel Proust resided at No. 102, where he famously wrote a significant portion of his masterpiece, À la recherche du temps perdu. Today, visitors can admire Proust's cork-lined bedroom, displayed in the Carnavalet Museum, as a testament to his literary legacy.nnAnother cultural gem along the boulevard is the Musée Jacquemart-André, located at No. 158. This remarkable museum showcases an exquisite art collection, offering visitors a glimpse into the world of art and culture.nnBoulevard Haussmann's significance extends beyond its architectural and cultural heritage. In 1975, the British department store chain Marks & Spencer opened its first store in continental Europe on this bustling street, leaving an indelible mark on the boulevard's commercial landscape.nnIn the realm of fiction, Boulevard Haussmann gained notoriety as the solidest street in Paris in Ian Fleming's novel Thunderball. In the book, it serves as the headquarters of the nefarious organization SPECTRE, adding an intriguing layer to the boulevard's storied history.nnToday, Boulevard Haussmann continues to captivate visitors with its grandeur and charm. It remains a vibrant hub of commerce, culture, and architectural splendor, attracting locals and tourists alike to explore its tree-lined sidewalks, shop at iconic department stores, and marvel at the rich history that unfolds along its magnificent stretch.",

  "Medium": "Step into history at Narikala Fortress, an ancient citadel overlooking the stunning views of Tbilisi and the Mtkvari River. This fortress, built as early as the 4th century AD during the reign of King Varaz-Bakur, has weathered the storm of various invasions and occupations over the centuries, from the Persians to the Mongols, who renamed it Narin Qala meaning Little Fortress.  The fortification, positioned between Tbilisi's sulfur baths and botanical gardens, is a testament to the architectural prowess of the times. It consists of two walled sections, each revealing different layers of Tbilisi's historical narrative. Notably, the majority of the extant fortifications are from the 16th and 17th centuries, highlighting the city's continuous ability to rebuild and evolve.  The centerpiece of the fortress is the St Nicholas church, which was reconstructed in 1997 after a devastating fire destroyed the original 13th-century church. The new structure stays true to the prescribed cross type of architecture, with doors on three sides. The interior is adorned with frescos, presenting scenes from the Bible and the annals of Georgian history, thus providing an artistic glimpse into the religious and cultural evolution of Georgia.  Unfortunately, an earthquake in 1827 caused significant damage to parts of the fortress, leading to their demolition.

  "Long": "Embark on a historical journey at Narikala Fortress, an ancient stronghold that dominates the skyline of Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, and oversees the majestic Mtkvari River. According to legend, this ancient fortress was established in the 4th century AD during King Varaz-Bakur's reign. Over the centuries, it has endured various invasions, shifts in rule, and the relentless march of time, but its walls tell a story of resilience and persistence.  Nestled between Tbilisi's therapeutic sulfur baths and lush botanical gardens, Narikala Fortress is a historic treasure trove waiting to be discovered. It's composed of two walled sections, each with their own distinct narratives. Although it initially fell into Persian hands, it was reclaimed by the kings of Kartli in the 5th century. It experienced significant expansion in the 7th century under the Umayyads and later under King David the Builder in the 11th century.  Interestingly, the fortress received its present name from the Mongols who, impressed by its formidable nature, named it Narin Qala, translating to Little Fortress. Despite its title, there's nothing 'little' about the history and culture enshrined within its walls. The existing fortifications mainly date back to the 16th and 17th centuries, silently narrating tales of past inhabitants and their determination to safeguard their city.  At the heart of Narikala is the recently restored St Nicholas church. Although the original 13th-century church succumbed to a fire, the reconstructed version, completed in 1996-1997, successfully mirrors its predecessor. It adheres to the prescribed cross architectural style, with doors gracing three sides of the structure.  The inner sanctum of St Nicholas church offers a vibrant canvas of Georgia's religious and historical journey. Its walls are adorned with frescos, visually narrating scenes from the Bible as well as significant episodes from Georgia's history. These artistic renditions offer a unique opportunity to appreciate the intertwining of faith and history in this ancient land.  Tragically, an earthquake in 1827 significantly damaged parts of the fortress, resulting in some sections being demolished. However, like a phoenix, Narikala has risen from its ashes time and again, reinforcing its image as a symbol of Georgia's tenacity.  Today, as you wander around its ancient walls, gaze at the city sprawled below, and admire the artwork within the St Nicholas church, Narikala Fortress provides a mesmerizing snapshot of Georgia's past. It's more than just a historical monument; it's a testament to the resilience of a city that has successfully preserved its rich heritage while advancing into the future.",

  "Long": "Welcome to the imposing Holy Trinity Cathedral of Tbilisi, affectionately known as Sameba. Towering over Georgia's capital, this cathedral serves as the heart of the Georgian Orthodox Church. Built between 1995 and 2004, Sameba ranks as the third-tallest Eastern Orthodox cathedral globally and one of the largest religious buildings by total area.  The idea to build Sameba, conceived in 1989, aimed to commemorate 1,500 years of autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church and 2,000 years since Jesus's birth. However, civil unrest delayed this ambitious plan until 1995 when construction finally commenced.  Sameba's architectural design, crafted by Archil Mindiashvili, is an elegant blend of traditional Georgian styles with Byzantine undertones, paying tribute to Georgia's historical architectural evolution.

The cathedral's completion in 2004 was celebrated on St. George's Day, with its consecration attended by Orthodox Churches' high-ranking representatives, leaders of other religious communities in Georgia, and political figures. This event underlined the significance of Sameba as a beacon of national and spiritual revival. The fact that its construction was funded primarily by anonymous donations from various strata of society is a testament to the shared respect and dedication to the Georgian Orthodox Church.  The Sameba complex includes a free-standing bell-tower, the residence of the Patriarch, a monastery, clerical seminary, and theological academy, and several workshops, representing a comprehensive spiritual center for worship, learning, and reflection. Despite a somewhat controversial history regarding the land it occupies, which was once the Khojavank Armenian cemetery, Sameba stands as a testament to the resilience and unity of the Georgian people.  However, as visitors, while you marvel at its grandeur and appreciate the spiritual and artistic treasures housed within, it's essential to remember the checkered past of the land it occupies. This encourages a broader understanding of Georgia's intricate social fabric and history, underscoring the importance of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence between different cultures and faiths. In doing so, Sameba, in all its splendor, serves as a reminder of Georgia's enduring spirit and its path towards unity and prosperity.   ",

You are standing in Freedom Square, a place that is more than just a geographical location, but a tapestry of Georgia's history, struggle, and ultimate triumph over oppression. Located at the eastern end of Rustaveli Avenue, this square carries with it a fascinating history.  Under Imperial Russia, this square was known as Erivansky Square, named after Ivan Paskevich, a Ukrainian general who earned his title by conquering Erivan (now Yerevan) for the Russian Empire. But as political tides shifted, so did the square's name. During the Soviet era, it became Beria Square, then Lenin Square, mirroring the change in power and ideologies of the time.  It was only after 1918, when the First Georgian Republic was founded following the Russian Empire's collapse, that the square got its current name: Freedom Square. This was more than a name; it was a declaration of Georgia's hard-fought sovereignty. Since then, the square has been a stage for momentous historical events. It was the site of the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery and various mass demonstrations calling for Georgia's independence from the Soviet Union. Even in recent history, Freedom Square was where U.S. President George W. Bush and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili addressed a crowd of around 100,000 people in 2005, marking the end of World War II's 60th anniversary.  Freedom Square isn't just a place of political significance. It's a hub of culture and art, too. The most prominent feature is the Liberty Monument, a stunning piece by Zurab Tsereteli, featuring St George triumphantly slaying the dragon. This isn't just a heroic scene from legend; it's a metaphor for Georgia's victory over its past oppressors. Nearby, a bust of Alexander Pushkin, a famed Russian poet, adds to the square's artistic allure.  On the square's northern side, you'll notice an open space with a fountain, a quiet place to rest and take in the area's vibrancy. This place was once the burial ground of Simon Ter-Petrossian, famously known as Kamo, a renowned communist figure whose remains were moved to an undisclosed location during Stalin's rule.  Surrounding the square, several important buildings add to its grandeur. The Tbilisi City Assembly, the former Bank of Georgia head office, and the Courtyard by Marriott Tbilisi all contribute to the unique architectural landscape. There are also ongoing works to accommodate the Old Tbilisi local government office here.  The significance of Freedom Square goes beyond its historical and artistic importance.

Unveiled in 2010, this bow-shaped pedestrian bridge stretches 150 metres over the Kura River, connecting the green expanse of Rike Park with the cobblestone streets of Old Tbilisi.  The brainchild of Italian architect Michele De Lucchi, who also designed Tbilisi's Ceremonial Palace of Georgia and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the bridge's distinctive wave-like design has often been compared to a marine creature.

Over time, however, the bridge has become an integral part of the cityscape and a beloved symbol of the capital. Its unusual shape even earned it the playful nickname 'Always Ultra Bridge', after its supposed resemblance to a ladies' maxi-pad.  The Bridge of Peace stands as a testament to Tbilisi's journey from a historic town to a burgeoning metropolis.

As you walk across this bridge, you're not just crossing the Kura River—you're traversing through Tbilisi's rich past, vibrant present, and promising future.

  "Long": "Step into the remarkable world of Georgian performing arts at the Georgian National Opera and Ballet Theater, an artistic cornerstone in Tbilisi since 1851. Residing on the vibrant Rustaveli Avenue, the theater is housed in an exotic Moorish Revival edifice, a testament to the design genius of Victor Schröter. While its façade invokes a definitive Oriental allure, the interior sings a different tune, presenting the traditional layout, foyers, and main hall of a European opera house, adorned with colored velvet, gold, silver, and imported silks.  Throughout its history, the theater has proven its resilience, overcoming multiple fires and reconstruction periods, including a significant restoration completed in 2016. Its persistence mirrors the Georgian people's resilience, making the opera house a symbol of the nation's unwavering commitment to culture and the arts, even amidst adversity.  The theater is named after Zacharia Paliashvili, a renowned Georgian composer whose work encapsulates the spirit of Georgian music. It also houses the State Ballet of Georgia, led by internationally acclaimed ballerina, Nina Ananiashvili. Over the years, the stage has seen a procession of esteemed performers, from the likes of Montserrat Caballé and José Carreras to local talents showcasing traditional Georgian-language performances. The breadth of its performances exemplifies its commitment to preserving Georgian culture while embracing global artistic trends.  However, the theater is not just a celebration of music and dance; it's a testament to Georgia's tumultuous past. The establishment of the opera house was a significant part of the political processes following Georgia's annexation by the Russian Empire in 1801. To appease and integrate Georgian aristocracy into Imperial society, Count Mikhail Vorontsov, the then Viceroy of the Caucasus, endorsed the creation of the opera house, fostering a cultural initiative that held considerable political implications.  The original theater, an opulent spectacle with artwork by Russian painter Grigory Gagarin, was reduced to rubble in a devastating fire in 1874. However, the tragedy spurred the city to resurrect the cultural icon. A contest for a new architectural design resulted in Schröter's winning design and the construction of the now-familiar Oriental-inspired structure.  Its grand opening in 1851 welcomed the high society of Tbilisi, marking the beginning of a new era in Georgian arts. It was a beacon of light during the tumultuous political climate of the 19th century, offering the people of Tbilisi an escape into a world of music, dance, and drama. Over the years, it has remained a place of cultural significance, even during periods of political instability, including the unrest in the 1990s.  Today, as the heart of Tbilisi's cultural life, the theater continues to host a diverse range of performances, serving as a platform for national celebrations and high-profile receptions. A visit to the Georgian National Opera and Ballet Theater is not just a cultural experience; it's a journey through Georgia's past and present, a tale of resilience, revival, and the enduring power of art. A tour of this iconic institution is a must for every visitor seeking to understand the soul of Tbilisi.",

  "Medium": "Dear travelers, welcome to the heart of Tbilisi - the Anchiskhati Basilica of St Mary. This basilica, built in the 6th century by King Dachi of Iberia, holds the title as the oldest surviving church in the city. Originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary, it was renamed Anchiskhati in 1675 when a revered icon of the Savior was moved here from the Ancha monastery to safeguard it from an Ottoman invasion.  The basilica's history is a testament to Georgia's turbulent past, having been rebuilt several times due to wars with Persians and Turks. A significant transformation occurred in the 1870s when a dome was added to the structure. During the Soviet era, the church served secular purposes - first as a museum of handicrafts, then an art studio. However, the 1500th Jubilee of Tbilisi saw a series of restorations from 1958 to 1964, reverting the church back to its 17th-century state. With Georgia's independence in 1991, the basilica returned to religious use.  As we step inside, observe the unique three-span basilica architecture, divided by horseshoe-shaped abutments - a testament to its ancient construction. Although originally built with yellow tuff stone, a 20th-century restoration introduced extensive use of brick. The altarpiece, commissioned by Catholicos Nikoloz Amilakhvari in 1683, stands out amongst the 19th-century paintings.

  "Long": "Greetings, fellow explorers! Let's step back in time to the 6th century with the oldest surviving church in Tbilisi - the Anchiskhati Basilica of St Mary. King Dachi of Iberia, who made Tbilisi his capital, laid the foundations of this historic structure, originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The name 'Anchiskhati' was adopted in 1675 when the precious icon of the Savior, a masterpiece by the 12th-century goldsmith Beka Opizari, was relocated here from the Ancha monastery in present-day Turkey to evade an Ottoman invasion.  The basilica's tumultuous history is a reflection of the wars between Georgia and its invaders, the Persians and Turks, which led to its repeated damage and restoration between the 15th and 17th centuries. Catholicos Domenti added a brick belfry near the Anchiskhati Basilica in 1675, and a dome was introduced in the 1870s, significantly altering its appearance.  During the Soviet period, religious activities at Anchiskhati Basilica were halted, and it transitioned into a museum for handicrafts and later an art studio. However, the 1500th Jubilee of Tbilisi in the late 1950s sparked a wave of restoration efforts, reviving the basilica's 17th-century facade. It wasn't until 1991, following Georgia's independence, that the church returned to its sacred purpose.  Walking through Anchiskhati Basilica is like traversing through time. The basilica showcases a unique three-span design divided by two horseshoe-shaped abutments, a mark of its antique construction. Originally built with blocks of yellow tuff stone, the church now prominently features bricks, a result of the restorations in the late 20th century. Despite having entrances on three sides, only the western one is currently in use.  Inside, the Anchiskhati Basilica boasts an array of artwork, the most remarkable of which is the altarpiece commissioned by Catholicos Nikoloz Amilakhvari in 1683. Alongside it, you will find paintings from the 19th century, each one a silent narrator of Georgia's rich history and religious traditions.  But Anchiskhati Basilica isn't just a silent witness to history. It's a thriving cultural center, home to the world-renowned Anchiskhati Choir, the leading exponent of Georgian polyphonic choral music. Listening to their harmonious melodies within the ancient walls of the basilica is a soul-stirring experience, a must-try during your visit.  From surviving invasions and wars to serving secular purposes and ultimately reclaiming its religious significance, Anchiskhati Basilica embodies the resilience of Georgian spirit. Its history, architecture, and cultural offerings make it an unmissable destination in Tbilisi. Whether you are an art lover, history buff, or a music enthusiast, the Anchiskhati Basilica of St Mary is sure to captivate your heart.",

  "Long": "Welcome to Abanotubani, Tbilisi's enchanting ancient district, renowned for its characteristic sulphuric baths. This district, situated at the base of the majestic Narikala fort and along the eastern bank of the Mtkvari River, is more than just a geographical landmark. It's a cornerstone of Georgian history and culture.  Abanotubani's significance is deeply intertwined with Tbilisi's founding story. According to legend, King Vakhtang Gorgasali's falcon fell into these hot springs. The king, entranced by the springs, decided to establish the city of Tbilisi around them.  The baths themselves have been recognized since ancient times for their restorative properties. As early as the 13th century, Tbilisi was home to 65 mineral water baths, a fact recorded by Arab geographer Ibn Hawqal, comparing them to the baths of Tiberias that boil without fire. Even famous Venetian traveler Marco Polo in the 13th-14th centuries, and Russian merchant Vasil Gagara in the 18th century, chronicled their experiences of these baths, testament to their international fame.  A stroll around Abanotubani will reveal the remarkable architectural influences from 17th and 18th century Iran. Most of the surviving baths were designed during this era, characterized by domed roofs and intricate brickwork. These baths, located in Seydabad, mark the start of the ascent to the Botanical Garden and thus, this area was named Abanotubani, translating to the bath district.

In the past, citizens spent entire days here, bathing, unwinding, and even partaking in lavish feasts. The baths were also entwined with societal customs - future mothers-in-law would traditionally inspect the beauty of a bride here.  Visiting these baths today is akin to experiencing a slice of Georgia's vibrant history and culture. As you immerse in the healing waters, soak in the historical atmosphere around you. Envision the bustling gatherings, elaborate feasts, and societal rituals that once took place within these walls.

  "Long": "Welcome to the heart of Tbilisi, the Sioni Cathedral of the Dormition. Nestled in the historic Sionis Kucha and overlooking the Kura River, this Georgian Orthodox cathedral's name echoes Mount Zion in Jerusalem. Constructed in the 6th and 7th centuries, the Cathedral has seen invasions, natural disasters, and significant socio-political changes. Today's structure, based on the 13th-century design, bears the imprints of these turbulent periods, making it a fascinating historical timeline for visitors.  The Sioni Cathedral holds the key to Georgia's rich architectural legacy, spanning centuries. The inscribed cross-in-square design and the polygonal apses on the eastern facade showcase medieval Georgian church architecture. Despite multiple reconstructions, the basic elements remain from King David the Builder's design in 1112, offering glimpses into the architectural brilliance of that era.  Stepping inside, you'll be awestruck by the striking murals composed by Russian artist Grigory Gagarin between 1850 and 1860. These vibrant pieces, along with those by Georgian artist Levan Tsutskiridze from the 1980s, lend the cathedral's interior a unique artistic aura. Gagarin also designed the stone iconostasis dating back to the 1850s, replacing the original wooden one burned during the Persian invasion in 1795.  One of the cathedral's most treasured artifacts is the Grapevine cross, associated with Saint Nino. As per tradition, this Cappadocian woman forged the cross and was instrumental in introducing Christianity to the Caucasus in the 4th century. It's an artifact of spiritual significance that connects modern Georgia with its ancient Christian roots.  The cathedral's history intertwines with significant events in Georgia's past. The Russian Imperial manifesto announcing Georgia's annexation was first made public here in 1802. It was a momentous event, shaping Georgia's future. The cathedral has also served as the main Georgian Orthodox Cathedral and the seat of the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia until the Holy Trinity Cathedral was consecrated in 2004.  The Sioni Cathedral was also the site of various restorations, including the cupola and vaults by the Metropolitan of Tbilisi, Elise Saginashvili, in the 17th century. It even continued functioning throughout the Soviet era, with partial renovations undertaken between 1980 and 1983.  Near the cathedral, within the courtyard, a three-story bell tower stands tall. This structure, dating from the 1425 reconstruction by King Alexander I and restored in 1939 after being largely destroyed by Persian Shah Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar in 1795, is another architectural marvel.  The Sioni Cathedral's journey is a remarkable narrative of resilience, strength, and enduring faith.

  "Long": "Welcome to the Fine Art Museum of Georgia, an artistic gem in the heart of Tbilisi. Known as the Shalva Amiranashvili Museum of Fine Arts, this museum is home to a wide-ranging collection of Georgian, Oriental, Russian, and European art. Established in 1920, the museum's expansive collection of approximately 140,000 pieces makes it one of Georgia's leading art institutions.  The museum was initially launched as the National Art Gallery by a group of Western-educated Georgian artists. It subsequently evolved into the Central Museum of Fine Arts in 1923. The museum was relocated to the old city's center in 1932, on the site of the 13th-century Metekhi church. It officially became the Art Museum of Georgia in 1950 when it moved into its current neoclassical building, constructed in 1838 as a theological seminary during the Imperial Russian period.  Shalva Amiranashvili, a celebrated Georgian art historian, played a crucial role in shaping the museum's collection. His efforts over a tenure of more than thirty years brought many significant pieces to the museum, meriting the institution to be named after him. In 2004, the museum was incorporated into the Georgian National Museum, marking another key milestone in its history.  As you explore the museum, you'll encounter a vast array of Georgian art illustrating the nation's artistic culture's evolution from ancient times to the present. This collection provides an extraordinary insight into the country's rich artistic tradition, making it a vital part of the museum.  The Oriental section is another highlight, ranking among the largest in the post-Soviet countries. The collection showcases the brilliance of Persian fine arts, particularly from the Qajar era. It includes several miniatures by Persian court artists, displaying images of court beauties and portraits of shahs and noblemen. These artworks present a beautiful reflection of the Persian court's life and its artistic preferences.  The museum's Russian and European collections add further depth to the artistic journey, presenting a diverse range of art styles and periods. The story of the stolen and then returned 16th-century painting The Procuress by Lucas Cranach the Elder adds a layer of intrigue and history to the collection.  Regularly, the museum hosts temporary exhibitions, featuring works from different collections within the country and from abroad. These exhibitions bring fresh perspectives and narratives to the museum, ensuring there's always something new for the visitors.  The Art Museum of Georgia offers a unique journey into the artistic heritage of Georgia and beyond.

  "Short": "Welcome to the stunning Kashveti Church of St. George! A masterful blend of Georgian, Italian, and German influences, this Georgian Orthodox Church stands across the Parliament building in the heart of Tbilisi. Constructed from 1904 to 1910, its architecture echoes the medieval Samtavisi Cathedral. Breathtaking frescoes by celebrated Georgian artist Lado Gudiashvili adorn the interior, illustrating Christian stories with ancient encaustic techniques. A site of deep historical and religious significance, Kashveti takes its name from an old legend featuring the 6th-century monk, David of Gareja, who proved his innocence against false accusations by causing a woman to give birth to a stone. This story, reflected in the church's name, weaves faith, history, and miracles together, attracting believers and tourists alike.",
  "Medium": "Welcome to the magnificent Kashveti Church of St. George, an architectural jewel standing proudly in central Tbilisi, opposite the Parliament building. Kashveti's design, crafted by the architect Leopold Bilfeldt, is inspired by the medieval Samtavisi Cathedral, culminating in a harmonious blend of Italian marble and carvings copied from various ancient churches in Georgia.  The church was built between 1904 and 1910, replacing a previous structure from 1753 that had fallen into disrepair. Notably, the construction was saved from Soviet destruction in the 1920s thanks to Neophyte Agladze, a local master stone carver who contributed to Kashveti's ornate design.  Upon entering, your eyes will be captivated by the exquisitely painted frescoes created by Lado Gudiashvili, one of Georgia's most influential painters. His work, a testament to the encaustic painting method, features timeless Christian narratives and has survived the test of time.  The church is deeply rooted in Georgian Christianity. Its name, kashveti, stems from an intriguing tale about the 6th-century monk David of Gareja, a figure in the group of the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers. Falsely accused of impregnating a woman, David prophesied she would give birth to a stone in his defense, which she indeed did. This miracle birth gave the church its name and enhances its allure as a symbol of faith, history, and miracles.

  "Long": "Welcome to the inspiring Kashveti Church of St. George, an embodiment of Georgian Orthodox tradition and artistic splendor. Sitting opposite the Parliament building on Tbilisi's bustling Rustaveli Avenue, Kashveti's majestic silhouette narrates stories of faith, resilience, and artistry.  Constructed between 1904 and 1910, this church stands on hallowed ground. Previous structures date back to the 6th century, each one testament to the enduring spirit of Georgian Christianity. Kashveti replaced a deteriorating church from 1753, with contributions from the Georgian nobility and bourgeoisie funding the project. Architect Leopold Bilfeldt's design drew inspiration from the medieval Samtavisi Cathedral, combining it with Italian marble and diverse Georgian carvings to create a harmonious blend of architectural styles.  Though the church faced demolition during the anti-religious Soviet regime in the 1920s, it was saved through the quick thinking of Neophyte Agladze. As a master stone carver, Agladze's passion for his work led him to rally support and prevent the church's destruction, allowing Kashveti to stand as a beacon of faith even today.  Kashveti's interior is as remarkable as its history. The church's walls are adorned with enchanting frescoes painted by Lado Gudiashvili, a leading figure in Georgian art. Utilizing the ancient and robust encaustic painting method, Gudiashvili breathed life into Christian narratives, creating an immersive and spiritual experience for all visitors.  At the heart of Kashveti's history is the legend of David of Gareja, one of the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers who evangelized Georgia in the 6th century. Falsely accused of impregnating a woman, David declared that she would birth a stone to prove his innocence. Miraculously, this prophecy came to pass, resulting in the church's name kashveti, which translates to birth of a stone. This miraculous event not only reinforced the sanctity of the site but also symbolized the unwavering resilience and faith of the Georgian people.  Today, Kashveti Church stands as an iconic symbol of Georgia's rich religious history, architectural splendor, and enduring faith. Its remarkable blend of design influences, stunning frescoes, and legendary origins make it a must-visit destination for any visitor to Tbilisi. Whether you are a history buff, an art enthusiast, or a spiritual seeker, the Kashveti Church of St. George promises an unforgettable experience.",

This exceptional architectural gem was constructed by a wealthy Armenian merchant, Alexander Melik-Azaryants, in the Art Nouveau style between 1912-1915, reflecting Tbilisi's prevalent modernist architecture.  From its ornate stone-carved garlands and Czech sculptural reliefs that grace the facade, to the traditional Tbilisian wooden balconies that embellish the back, the house is an embodiment of textural contrast. The tale of its construction is as fascinating as its architecture. The merchant, initially outraged at the prospect of building on a landfill, eventually accepted the mayor's offer, leading to the creation of this unique edifice.  Notably, the house was the first multifunctional, modern-style building in all of Europe and Russia at the time. Housing hotel rooms, shops, a photo salon, preschool, cinema, art gallery, and a beautiful garden, it was a testament to innovative urban planning.

The house's sad and ascetic appearance, epitomized by teardrop windows and funeral wreaths, is a moving tribute to his loss.  During the Soviet Era, Azaryants’s property, including the house, was nationalized. He died in poverty, leaving behind this unique dwelling as his lasting legacy. Despite facing demolition threats several times, the house stands today as a cherished monument of Tbilisi's cultural heritage.

Today, the church continues to be a place of worship and a fascinating historical site for tourists.",
  "Medium": "The Virgin Mary Assumption Church of Metekhi, located on a cliff overlooking the Kura river, is a stunning example of Georgian architectural grandeur, dating back to the 13th century. According to oral tradition, its origins could trace back to as early as the 5th century, built by the King Vakhtang I Gorgasali. However, most of its current structure was constructed under the reign of King Demetrius II, between 1278 and 1289 AD.  The church uniquely blends into the natural landscape, constructed to appear as an extension of the cliff. With three convex apses and a dome supported internally by four pillars, Metekhi's design differs from most churches of the time, making it a unique monument. The walls of the church are decorated with Georgian rock carvings, an artistic element characteristic of the Golden Age of 11th-12th centuries.  A tragic event in 1226 has been immortalized in the church's history. The Kwarazm-shah, Jalal ad-Din, ordered Tbilisi's citizens to step on religious icons or face execution. About 100,000 citizens who refused to desecrate their faith were executed, their heads floating down the Mtkvari River.  During the 17th century, the church underwent significant restorations due to damage from lightning. In the Soviet era, the church was used as a museum, theater, and even a prison, with prisoner names etched into its facade. It returned to its sacred function in 1988 and has since been a beacon of faith, history, and culture.",
  "Long": "Standing on the edge of the Metekhi Cliff, overlooking the old town of Tbilisi, lies the impressive structure of The Virgin Mary Assumption Church of Metekhi, an integral part of Georgia's rich history. Known locally as Metekhi Church, this Georgian Orthodox Christian place of worship has roots dating back to the 13th century, with oral tradition hinting at an even earlier foundation in the 5th century by the King Vakhtang I Gorgasali. Despite these early roots, the bulk of its current structure was erected under the rule of King Demetrius II between 1278 and 1289 AD.  An exquisite example of Georgian architecture, Metekhi Church seamlessly blends with its natural surroundings, designed to look like an extension of the cliff it sits upon. Its unique architectural style boasts three convex apses and a dome, supported internally by four pillars, standing in contrast to the typical two-pillar design of the 11th century. These structural elements contribute to Metekhi's uniqueness and the invaluable insights it provides into historical architectural trends.  The exterior walls, crafted from hewn quadras, have been adorned with traditional Georgian rock carvings, exuding a distinct charm associated with the Golden Age of 11th-12th centuries. The eastern facade features the best-preserved carvings, offering an intricate display of rhombic rosettes and convex architraves. While no original murals have survived inside, various icons, such as the 100000 martyrs, narrate stories of the past.  One of the most tragic events connected to the church took place in 1226 when the town was seized by troops led by Kwarazm-shah, Jalal ad-Din. He presented an appalling ultimatum to Tbilisi's inhabitants: step on religious icons from Sioni Church, which were laid on the Metekhi Bridge, or face beheading. Defying this sacrilegious command, about 100,000 citizens were executed, their heads sent floating down the Mtkvari River, a grim reminder of the price paid for steadfast faith.  Over the centuries, Metekhi Church has weathered a variety of transformations. In the 17th century, after a lightning strike, significant restoration work was undertaken. In the 18th century, changes were made, including the addition of a southern entrance and the substitution of original hewn quadras with bricks on the southern facade.  During the Soviet era, the church was repurposed several times. It served as a prison during the early Soviet era, with prisoners leaving their mark by scratching their names into the church's facade. It was then transformed into a depository for the National Museum of Art's collections and later served as a youth theater in the 1970s.  Despite the turbulent times and multiple threats of demolition, Metekhi Church survived and was reinstated as a place of worship in 1988. Today, this remarkable monument stands as a testament to Georgia's rich history, a symbol of resilient faith, and a captivating attraction for both locals and tourists alike, offering a unique glimpse into the country's religious, cultural, and architectural heritage.",
