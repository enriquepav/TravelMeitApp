In addition to its architectural beauty and cultural events, Raekoja plats also has a rich history. The square was once used as a market square, and it was also the site of a legendary public excecution. The legend tells that In the late 1600s an angry priest threw a tankard full of warm beer at a barmaid, cracking her skull and killing her. Incensed with rage, the rabble of onlookers dragged the priest outside and demanded permission from the town hall to deliver swift, instant justice. Executions were usually enacted outside of the Old Town but such was the aggression of the mob, the priest was killed then and there. Today, the square is a much more peaceful place, with street performers and artists entertaining visitors throughout the day.    In recent years, Raekoja plats has also been the site of political demonstrations, as Estonians have used the square to express their views on various issues, including the war in Ukraine and the treatment of ethnic minorities in Estonia.

      "Medium": "Perched atop Toompea Hill in the heart of Tallinn, Toompea Castle is a remarkable medieval fortress that has witnessed centuries of history and transformations. Its origins can be traced back to the 9th century AD when it served as a stronghold for the ancient Estonians. In 1219, the castle fell into the hands of Danish crusaders led by King Valdemar II, and it became known as the Castle of the Danes.    Over the years, the castle saw several changes in ownership, including the Order of the Brethren of the Sword and the Teutonic Order. The castle underwent significant rebuilding and expansion in the 13th century, which laid the foundation for its current structure. Notable features include the imposing towers such as Pilsticker,St√ºr den Kerl,Landskrone, and the iconic Langer Hermann Tall Hermann, which stands at an impressive height of 48 meters and proudly flies the Estonian flag.    During the 16th century, the castle's role shifted as the region became contested by Sweden, Poland, and Muscovy. The Swedes transformed Toompea Castle into a center of political power in Estonia, turning it from a fortress into a ceremonial and administrative hub. It continued to serve this purpose after Estonia came under the rule of the Russian Empire in 1710.    In the 19th century, further modifications were made, including the addition of a new wing in Baroque and Neoclassical style, designed by Johann Schultz. This wing housed the provincial administration and the living quarters of the imperial governor. The surrounding area was transformed into a public park, enhancing the castle's surroundings.    After Estonia gained independence in 1918, the former convent building of the Teutonic Order was chosen as the site for the new parliament building, known as the Riigikogu. Completed in 1922, the parliament building exhibits a unique combination of traditionalist exterior design and Expressionist interior style, making it the world's only Expressionist parliament building.    Throughout its history, Toompea Castle has witnessed the ebb and flow of power and played a vital role in Estonia's governance.

      "Long": "Toompea Castle, majestically situated on Toompea Hill in the heart of Tallinn, is a fascinating medieval fortress that has shaped the course of Estonian history. Its origins can be traced back to the 9th century AD, when it served as an ancient Estonian stronghold. However, the castle as we see it today primarily dates back to the 13th century when extensive rebuilding and expansion took place. The castle's rich history is intertwined with the rise and fall of various powers and orders.    In 1219, Toompea Castle was seized by Danish crusaders led by King Valdemar II during the Battle of Lindanise. According to Danish legend, the flag of Denmark, known as Dannebrog, fell from the sky during the battle, marking a decisive moment. This event contributed to the castle being referred to as the Castle of the Danes or castrum danorum, giving rise to the possible origin of the city's name, Tallinn.    The castle changed hands several times over the following centuries. In 1227, the Order of the Brethren of the Sword took control and initiated rebuilding efforts. It was during this time that the castle began to resemble a monastery, with the addition of a chapel, chapter house, and dormitory for the knights. The castle's towers, including Pilsticker, St√ºr den Kerl, Landskrone, and the iconic Langer Hermann or Tall Hermann, were constructed under the order's rule.    In 1237, Toompea Castle was once again under Danish control, but in 1346, it was sold to the Teutonic Order, which maintained ownership throughout the Middle Ages. The castle's significance as a religious order became evident through its monastery-like features and its role as a center of power in Estonia.    During the 16th century, the Livonian War brought significant changes to the region, and the crusader orders dissolved. Sweden, Poland, and Muscovy (Russia) vied for control, leading to Swedish dominion over northern Estonia by 1561. The Swedes transformed Toompea Castle from a fortress into a ceremonial and administrative center, solidifying its position as a symbol of political power in Estonia.    In 1710, Estonia became part of the Russian Empire as a result of the Great Northern War, and Toompea Castle underwent further reconstruction. The building complex transitioned from a castle to a palace, with the addition of a new wing in Baroque and Neoclassical style designed by Johann Schultz. This wing housed the provincial administration and the living quarters of the imperial governor. The castle's surroundings were also enhanced during this period, with the creation of a public park and the construction of an adjacent archive building.    In 1918, Estonia gained independence, and the former convent building of the Teutonic Order was chosen as the site for the new parliament building, known as the Riigikogu. Designed by architects Eugen Habermann and Herbert Johanson, the parliament building was completed in 1922. Its exterior reflects traditionalist aesthetics, while the interior features an Expressionist style, making it the world's only Expressionist parliament building.    During the period of foreign occupations, which included Soviet and Nazi German rule, the parliament of Estonia was disbanded. However, Toompea Castle and the Riigikogu building continued to serve as venues for the Soviet-backed Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR.    Today, Toompea Castle stands as a symbol of Estonia's governance and heritage. Visitors can explore its historic halls, witness the parliamentary proceedings, and admire the architectural grandeur that reflects centuries of history. The castle's iconic tower, Tall Hermann, remains a prominent feature on the Tallinn skyline, and the Estonian flag is raised and lowered atop the tower each day to the sound of the national anthem.    Perched high on Toompea Hill, Toompea Castle invites visitors to delve into the captivating stories of Estonia's past, appreciate its architectural splendor, and witness firsthand the workings of the modern Estonian Parliament.",

      "Long": "Welcome to St. Olaf's Church, a remarkable testament to Tallinn's medieval heritage and architectural grandeur. This historic church, believed to have been built in the 12th century, is steeped in rich history and captivating legends that have shaped its identity.    Originally serving as the spiritual center for the Scandinavian community in Tallinn, the church was named after King Olaf II of Norway, also known as St. Olaf. Its earliest written records date back to 1267, but it underwent extensive reconstruction during the 14th century, giving it the distinctive Gothic and medieval features that we see today.    Standing tall at 124 meters, the church's spire has witnessed a tumultuous history. It has been ravaged by fires and restored multiple times, altering its height over the centuries. At its zenith, from 1549 to 1625, it proudly held the title of the tallest building in the world, reaching an awe-inspiring height of 159 meters. This remarkable feat of engineering was a testament to the city's ambition and desire for a prominent landmark visible from afar, particularly from the sea, as trade played a crucial role in Tallinn's prosperity.    One of the most intriguing aspects of St. Olaf's Church is the legend that surrounds its construction. According to the tale, the citizens of Tallinn aspired to build the tallest church in the world. However, a curse claimed the life of anyone who completed its construction, deterring all potential builders. One day, an unknown person offered to complete the task for a significant sum of money. The city, unable to afford the amount, was presented with a challenge: if they could discover the mysterious builder's name, he would forgive their debt. Determined to succeed, the people of Tallinn sent a spy to his house, who overheard the name Olev in a song sung by his wife. With this information, they waited until the foreigner completed the construction and was placing the cross on the tower. Seizing the opportunity, the crowd below shouted, Olev, the cross is crooked! Startled, the builder fell to the ground, revealing a toad and a snake that emerged from his mouth, signifying his demonic possession. This gripping legend is depicted in a mural painting on one side of the church, adding to its mystique.    Throughout history, St. Olaf's Church has undergone various transformations in its religious affiliation.

The Estonian National Opera has a dedicated team of over 500 individuals who contribute to the vibrant cultural scene of Estonia. The opera company's performances take place at the Estonia Theatre, which has played a pivotal role in Estonian cultural history.  Established in 1870, the song and drama society Estonia laid the foundation for the development of the opera company. Over time, the theatre began staging song plays, folk plays, and comedies, eventually expanding its repertoire to include more serious dramas by the start of the 20th century.  In 1906, the Estonia society served as the basis for the establishment of the professional theatre called Estonia under the direction of Paul Pinna and Theodor Altermann. This marked a significant milestone in the development of the opera company, which remained associated with the Estonia society and the Estonian Theatre Estonia Limited Liability Company until 1940 when it was disbanded under Soviet rule and nationalized.  Throughout its history, the Estonian National Opera has achieved notable milestones.

Delving into the square's intriguing history, it's worth noting that Towers Square was once considered as a potential site for the construction of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in the late 19th century. However, this idea was abandoned due to the proximity of the noisy railway station.    Following World War II, the square underwent a transformation in nomenclature, being renamed Stalingradskaya square, which persisted from 1945 to 1961. During this period, it witnessed various changes and events that shaped the city's post-war landscape.    Another noteworthy aspect is the presence of the Mikhail Kalinin monument erected on the square in 1950. However, with changing times and shifting societal values, the monument was dismantled in 1990, marking a significant shift in the city's historical narrative.    In recent years, Towers Square has gained recognition as the host of the International Flower Festival during the summer months. This vibrant celebration of nature and beauty adorned the square with a colorful display of blossoms. However, in 2019, the festival did not take place due to a lack of participant interest, reflecting evolving trends and priorities.

  "Long": "The Great Coastal Gate, known as Suur Rannav√§rav in Estonian, has a storied history that stretches back to the 14th century. Originally constructed to protect Tallinn's harbor, the gate underwent significant expansions and additions over the centuries. One of the most notable additions was the construction of the Fat Margaret Tower in the 16th century.    The Fat Margaret Tower, also called Paks Margareeta, served as an artillery tower and played a vital role in the defense of the city. Its unique three-quarter circle shape, with a diameter of 25 meters, made it an impressive structure. The tower boasted thick walls, ranging from 2.25 to 5.5 meters, gradually decreasing in width towards the top. Its sturdy construction included strong wooden beam ceilings supported by a massive central stone post.    Throughout its existence, the Great Coastal Gate complex has witnessed several significant transformations. In the 19th century, Fat Margaret underwent a change in purpose and became a prison. Its imposing structure served as a deterrent for potential wrongdoers. In 1884, a four-floor limestone prison outbuilding was completed on the southern side of Fat Margaret, expanding the prison's capacity.    The complex suffered significant damage during the tumultuous events of the February Revolution in 1917. The prison was set ablaze, the prison warden was tragically killed, and the entire complex was left in ruins. However, in 1938-1940, extensive reconstruction efforts took place. The prison outbuilding and the barbican building were restored and repurposed as the City Museum premises. The walls of Fat Margaret were fixed and roofed, and the embrasures that had been repurposed as windows in the 19th century were restored to their original state.    In 1978-1981, the entire Great Coastal Gate complex underwent a comprehensive reconstruction to house the Estonian Maritime Museum. Reinforced concrete ceilings were added to Fat Margaret, the open platform floor was restored, and the artillery tower was given an exterior that closely resembled its original appearance.  The reconstruction and adaptation of the Coastal Gate and Fat Margaret tower complex were designed by Polish architect Jerzy Matusiak-Tusiacki in 1978-1979. The aim was to create a dedicated museum that would showcase Estonia's rich maritime history. Despite delays, the Estonian Maritime Museum officially opened its doors within the tower in 1981, offering visitors a captivating journey through Tallinn's seafaring past.    In 2018, the museum temporarily closed for renovations, focusing specifically on Fat Margaret. After an extensive restoration process, the new Fat Margaret Museum and Visitor Centre was unveiled in November 2019. Today, visitors can explore the museum's engaging exhibitions, which delve into Tallinn's maritime heritage, offering insights into navigation, trade, and the captivating stories behind the Great Coastal Gate and Fat Margaret Tower.    The Great Coastal Gate and Fat Margaret Tower stand as prominent cultural and historical landmarks in Tallinn. They symbolize the city's strategic importance, architectural prowess, and maritime legacy. As visitors wander through the complex, they are transported back in time, immersing themselves in the captivating tales of seafaring adventures, the defense of the harbor, and the enduring strength of Tallinn's fortifications. The Estonian Maritime Museum within Fat Margaret provides an enriching and educational experience, highlighting the maritime traditions that have shaped the region's identity over the centuries.",

In 1380, Wilhelm von Friemersheim, the Master of the Order, granted permission for the construction of a stone gate building. Over the centuries, the tower underwent several transformations and expansions, reflecting the evolving needs of Tallinn's defense system. In 1450, the tower was reconstructed, with additional protective floors and the installation of a staircase. This expansion likely increased the tower's height to approximately 20 meters, including an open defense floor. Notable payments were made to craftsmen during this period, including the blacksmith Rozenberg for gate devices and Claus Denen for crafting weather vanes in 1454 and 1455, respectively.    During the 16th and 17th centuries, Tallinn faced numerous challenges, prompting the fortification of its defenses. In 1594, a barrier was constructed in front of the Pika jala main gate, further enhancing the tower's defensive capabilities. In 1608, the top of the gate tower was rebuilt, contributing to its distinct architectural character.    Throughout the 19th century, the tower served various purposes, including being used as living quarters for soldiers stationed in Tallinn. However, in 1926, the tower underwent a significant transformation under the guidance of Ludvig Oskar Pika jala, an artist who embarked on the ambitious task of rebuilding the gate tower. Securing a bank loan of half a million marks, Pika jala demolished the old mantle chimney and made extensive renovations, including the installation of ovens and stoves on each floor. The Tallinn city government signed a lease agreement with Pika jala, initially for the years 1927-1939, but the term was later extended at his request.    For several years, Pika jala resided in the Long Leg Gate Tower, utilizing the space not only as living quarters but also as studios for artistic endeavors. However, his time in the tower came to an end when he fled to Germany in 1944 amidst the turmoil of World War II.    Following a devastating fire in 1995, the tower underwent a comprehensive restoration, including the addition of a new spire. The restoration efforts aimed to preserve the tower's historical significance and architectural integrity. Notably, the weather vane adorning the tower was forged by renowned metal artist Heino M√ºller, whose studio was once located within its walls.    Today, the Long Leg Gate Tower stands as a testament to Tallinn's rich history and vibrant artistic community. The tower serves as a unique living space and artistic hub, providing a glimpse into the city's cultural heritage. Visitors can marvel at its trapezoidal design, soak in the echoes of the past, and appreciate the creative energy that resonates within its restored walls. The Long Leg Gate Tower stands as a cherished piece of Tallinn's architectural heritage, connecting the city's past with its present.",

  "Medium": "Pikk Hermann, also referred to as Tall Hermann or Langer Hermann, is an iconic tower situated within the confines of Toompea Castle on Toompea hill in Tallinn, Estonia. Its construction dates back to the 14th century, and it underwent a significant rebuilding phase in the 16th century, reaching a height of 45.6 meters (150 ft). The tower boasts ten internal floors and a captivating viewing platform accessible via a 215-step staircase. Located adjacent to the Estonian Parliament building, Pikk Hermann serves as a powerful symbol of the government in force. At 95 meters (312 ft) above sea level, the flag atop the tower proudly displays the blue-black-white colors of Estonia. This symbolic gesture has deep historical significance, with the original flag being raised on Pikk Hermann for the first time on December 12, 1918, following Estonia's independence. However, during the Soviet occupation, the flag was removed and replaced with the flag of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was only on February 24, 1989, that the original flag was raised back on Pikk Hermann, reinstating the tower's symbolic role. To this day, the Estonian flag is ceremoniously raised and lowered on Pikk Hermann, accompanied by the national anthem and the song Mu isamaa on minu arm (My Fatherland is My Love). This tradition takes place during sunrise and sunset, respecting specific time constraints. Notably, during Otto Tief's brief interim government from September 18 to 22, 1944, the Estonian flag was also temporarily raised over Pikk Hermann, representing a significant moment in the nation's history.",
  "Long": "Pikk Hermann, known by several names such as Tall Hermann or Langer Hermann, stands as an enduring symbol of Tallinn, Estonia's capital city. Perched on Toompea hill within the grandeur of Toompea Castle, this tower holds a rich historical legacy. Its construction began in the 14th century, but it underwent significant reconstruction in the 16th century, resulting in its current height of 45.6 meters (150 ft). Visitors to Pikk Hermann can ascend its towering presence through a remarkable feat of 215 steps, leading them to ten internal floors and a breathtaking viewing platform at the pinnacle. The tower's strategic location adjacent to the Estonian Parliament building further emphasizes its significance. At 95 meters (312 ft) above sea level, the flag flying atop Pikk Hermann holds a special place in Estonia's symbolism. The blue-black-white colors represent the nation's identity and independence. The tradition of raising the Estonian flag on Pikk Hermann dates back to December 12, 1918, when the original flag was hoisted to commemorate Estonia's newfound independence. However, during the dark days of Soviet occupation, the flag was forcibly removed and replaced with the flag of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was not until February 24, 1989, that the original blue-black-white flag was reinstated on Pikk Hermann, reclaiming its symbolic significance. The flag-raising ceremony on Pikk Hermann is a cherished tradition observed during Estonia's Independence Day. At sunrise, the national flag, measuring 191 centimeters (75 in) by 300 centimeters (120 in), is ceremoniously raised to the top of the tower. The national anthem fills the air, followed by the resonant melody of Mu isamaa on minu arm (My Fatherland is My Love) as the flag is lowered during sunset. This poignant ritual pays tribute to the nation's heritage, resilience, and unity. Beyond its role as a venerated symbol, Pikk Hermann holds historical significance as well. During Otto Tief's brief interim government from September 18 to 22, 1944, the Estonian flag was once again unfurled atop the tower, serving as a symbol of resistance and hope during a turbulent time. Today, Pikk Hermann stands tall as a testament to Estonia's sovereignty and resilience. Its commanding presence, coupled with the fluttering flag, reminds both residents and visitors of the nation's enduring spirit. As one explores the tower's internal floors and gazes out from the viewing platform, they are treated to captivating panoramic vistas of Tallinn's historic skyline, connecting past, present, and future in a single moment of contemplation.",

  "Medium": "Maarjamae Palace, located in Tallinn, Estonia, has a fascinating history that reflects the changing times and uses of the site. Originally called Strietberg, it was a sought-after spot for summer leisure activities. In the late 17th century, a small summer manor was established there by Christian von Geldern, a councillor and member of the Brotherhood of Blackheads. Over the years, the site underwent various transformations. In 1811, a sugar factory was built on the premises by Johan Gottlieb Clementz, giving rise to the local name  Suhkrum√§gi  (Sugar Hill). By the 1820s, Tallinn had become a renowned beach resort, attracting visitors to the area. In 1861, Christian Abraham Rotermann, a councillor and entrepreneur, acquired the site and repurposed it as a starch and spirit factory. However, a devastating fire in 1869 brought an end to the factory operations. In 1873, the property changed hands once again, this time purchased by Count Anatoli Orlov-Davydov. He named the place Marienberg, later known as Maarjam√§e, after his wife, Maria. Over time, the Orlov-Davydov family emigrated, and the summer manor was leased. In 1933, Maarjam√§e Palace took on a new role as the grand opening of the Riviera-Palais restaurant-hotel attracted attention. With its elegant atmosphere and scenic surroundings, it became a popular destination for grand receptions and festive events. However, in 1937, the palace was purchased by the government, leading to its transformation into the Military Aviation School of the Republic of Estonia.

  "Long": "Maarjam√§e Palace, situated in Tallinn, Estonia, holds a remarkable history that reflects the transformation and uses of the site over the centuries. Originally known as Strietberg, it served as a popular summer retreat where people sought respite during the warm months. In the late 17th century, Christian von Geldern, a councillor and member of the Brotherhood of Blackheads, established a small summer manor on the site. In 1811, Johan Gottlieb Clementz, a merchant, purchased a plot of land at Strietberg and erected a sugar factory, leading locals to refer to the area as Suhkrum√§gi (Sugar Hill). By 1820, in addition to the factory building, there were eleven other stone structures, a wooden dwelling, sheds, a smithy, a lime kiln, an arched ice cellar, and a pool with canals used to direct water to the factory. The area was enclosed by a limestone wall standing over 4 meters high, and several of the stone buildings, the ice cellar, and parts of the perimeter wall have been preserved. In 1861, Christian Abraham Rotermann, a councillor and founder of a storeyard, acquired the sugar factory. He converted the premises into a starch and spirit factory, making significant contributions to Tallinn's industrial landscape. However, a devastating fire in 1869 destroyed the factory, leading Rotermann to cease operations at Strietberg. By the 1820s, Tallinn had gained renown as a beach resort, attracting visitors from near and far. On January 29, 1873, Count Anatoli Orlov-Davydov, a resident of St. Petersburg, acquired the Strietberg property and its buildings from Rotermann's heirs. The count named the place Marienberg, possibly in honor of his wife, Maria. The Estonian version of the name, Maarjam√§e, gained popularity in the late 1930s. With the Orlov-Davydov family's emigration following the 1917 revolution, the summer manor was leased to various occupants. In 1933, Maarjam√§e Palace underwent another transformation when it became the Riviera-Palais, an elegant restaurant-hotel that quickly became a renowned venue for grand receptions, literary and musical events, and Midsummer's Eve celebrations. Warm fireplaces, an illuminated glass dance floor, and scenic surroundings added to its allure. However, in 1937, the palace was acquired by the government, leading to its conversion into the Military Aviation School of the Republic of Estonia. The school welcomed its first students on November 1, 1937, and its mission was to train military pilots, reconnaissance pilots, and aircraft technicians. Reconstruction works were carried out, including the demolition of the veranda and balcony, altering the fa√ßade's appearance. In 1940, Maarjam√§e Palace came under the control of the Soviet Army. After the army vacated the premises, the palace was filled with apartments and communal kitchens. The once-neat and tidy area fell into disrepair and ruins. In the 1980s, restoration efforts took place to revive the palace and its historical significance. Restorers from the Wroclav department of the Polish company PKZ worked on the first stage of the palace complex from 1983 to 1988. The external appearance of the buildings, including the grand staircase, was meticulously restored based on old photographs and drawings. However, the interior was reconfigured to accommodate the needs of the museum. An annex was also constructed, featuring a two-story cinema hall adorned with bronze sculptures by Ants M√∂lder. Evald Okas created a mural titled  Friendship of Nations  in 1987 for the former summer hall of the palace, aligning with the prevailing zeitgeist. The palace connected to a Classicist auxiliary building from the first half of the 19th century, which now served as workrooms. In late 1987, the History and Revolution Museum of the Estonian SSR opened in the palace, presenting Estonian history from the mid-19th century to the modern era. It was the last permanent exhibition in Estonia subject to direct orders from the ideologists of the Estonian Communist Party's Central Committee. Following the restoration of Estonia's independence, the permanent exhibition was updated to reflect the country's new era. The auxiliary buildings on the slopes of Maarjam√§e were renovated and repurposed as museum depositories. The entire area continues to undergo general cleaning and landscaping. In 2008, the first-floor permanent exhibition was further updated, coinciding with the opening of the grand exhibition  Will to be free. 90 Years of the Republic of Estonia  commemorating the nation's 90th anniversary. On the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Estonia, Maarjam√§e Palace, as part of the Estonian History Museum, was unveiled as a history discovery center. The palace underwent renovations, and the Estonian Film Museum found its home in the surrounding park. Visitors can explore the exhibition  My Free Country,  which unfolds over 100 years, offering insights into Estonia's past and fostering discussions about its future. Additionally, children can engage in building their own country within the enjoyable Children's Republic. Maarjam√§e Palace stands as a testament to Estonia's rich history and cultural heritage.

  "Long": "Nestled at the southern end of Tallinn's Old Town, Freedom Square (Vabaduse v√§ljak) resonates with historical significance and symbolic weight. Designed by architects Tiit Trummal, Veljo Kaasik, and Andres Alver, the square has evolved from a humble parking lot to a dynamic plaza, fostering a sense of unity and collective identity. The square encompasses an expansive area of 7,752 m2, stretching approximately 110 meters by 75 meters. Its location is framed by notable landmarks, including St. John's Church, Kaarli Boulevard, and a remarkable Victory Column dedicated to the Estonian War of Independence (1918-1920). This column stands tall, embodying the enduring spirit and resilience of a nation. The history of Freedom Square intertwines with Tallinn's rich past. It rose on the grounds of the former Swedish bastion, which was dismantled in the mid-19th century. In 1867, St. John's Church emerged as a symbol of spiritual devotion and architectural grandeur, anchoring the square's eastern boundary. Subsequent developments, such as the transformation of the Haymarket into paved stones in 1910, marked the evolving character of the square. Amidst the seismic shifts of occupation, the square experienced a succession of name changes, each reflecting the prevailing political climate. From Victory Square to Freedom Square and back to Victory Square, the nomenclature mirrored Estonia's quest for independence and the challenging times that followed. Parades and celebrations commemorating Soviet holidays reverberated within its open space, bearing witness to the complex historical narratives etched into the nation's collective memory.

In 2005, the decision to erect a Column of Victory at Freedom Square was made by the Riigikogu, Estonia's parliament. A design competition ensued, attracting over 40 entries. The winning design, titled  Libertas,  was created by Rainer Sternfeld, Andri Laidre, Kadri Kiho, and Anto Savi, capturing the spirit of freedom and resilience.

  "Long": "The Danish King's Garden, located in Tallinn's Old Town west of R√º√ºtli Street, holds a significant place in the city's history and folklore. The garden derives its name from King Valdemar II, whose victorious campaign in 1219 established Danish rule in Tallinn and Northern Estonia for over a hundred years. According to legend, the Danes obtained their national flag, Dannebrog, at the very spot where the garden now stands. During a battle on the slopes of Toompea Hill, the Estonian malev (militia) attacked the Danish camp. In his desperate prayer for divine assistance, King Valdemar witnessed a miraculous event as a red flag with a white cross descended from the sky. Inspired by this celestial intervention, the Danish forces were able to repel their opponents and secure victory. In the 14th century, the garden earned its name   Garden of the Danish King   due to the gratitude of Tallinn's citizens. This recognition came in response to King Erik Menved's resolution of a dispute that arose during the planning of the Tallinn city wall. The king confirmed the construction line of the city wall, protecting Toompea and the lower city, thereby granting the merchants and craftsmen of Tallinn's sub-city the right to continue their activities in the area. This privilege bestowed upon the city-state the enduring right to utilize the slope of Toompea Mountain, ensuring that   no one was ever allowed to prevent or disturb   the people of Tallinn from exercising their freedom within this territory. The Danish King's Garden serves as a tranquil oasis within the historic Old Town. Amidst its verdant surroundings, the garden features a stone memorial plaque dedicated to the esteemed artists Paul and Kristjan Raua. Their contribution to the cultural heritage of Tallinn is commemorated in this serene setting.

The current building, a remarkable example of Renaissance Revival architecture, was designed by the renowned architect Georg Winterhalter and constructed between 1845 and 1848. In the aftermath of Estonia's independence in 1920, the Knighthood House witnessed a transformation as it became the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, symbolizing the nation's pursuit of diplomatic endeavors on the international stage.

  "Long": "Nestled within the enchanting Toompea district of Tallinn, the Estonian Knighthood House stands as an architectural gem with a compelling historical narrative. Since the 13th century, when Estonia was under the rule of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, German nobles assumed positions of power and influence in the region. As these nobles united under the Estonian Knighthood, the Knighthood House became their cherished gathering place, where celebrations and meetings were held and their esteemed peerage register was meticulously maintained. The current iteration of the Knighthood House, an exquisite embodiment of Renaissance Revival style, emerged through the vision of architect Georg Winterhalter and the craftsmanship of skilled builders between 1845 and 1848. It replaced its predecessors, which were lost to fires or outgrown by the burgeoning needs of the Knighthood. The winds of change swept through Estonia in 1920, as the nation gained independence and the privileges of the German Knights were revoked. The Knighthood House found a new purpose as it became Estonia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, symbolizing the country's diplomatic aspirations on the global stage. However, the course of history took another turn with the Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940. The nation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs ceased to exist, and the Knighthood House underwent a transformation yet again. From 1948 to 1992, it served as the National Library of Estonia, preserving and disseminating knowledge to generations of eager minds. During this time, the building became a sanctuary of learning, nurturing intellectual curiosity and fostering a sense of cultural heritage.

This infusion of artistic expression breathed new life into the building's storied halls, providing a space for contemplation and appreciation of Estonia's creative legacy. As the years unfolded, the art collection found its way back to Kadriorg Palace, where it could be fully showcased and celebrated. This transition paved the way for the restored palace and the grandeur of the Kumu Art Museum.

The pyramid is made of glass and steel and serves as the main entrance to the museum. A fact you may not know about the louvre is that it was the site of a heist. In 1911, long before all of the cameras and sensors, the Mona Lisa was stolen. In the dead of night, an Italian security guard locked himself in a storage cupboard so he wouldn‚Äôt have to leave the Louvre at the end of his shift.He waited until everyone had left the museum and stuffed the masterpiece into his jacket. When the museum opened the following morning, he simply walked out- with the masterpiece in tow.

Legend has it that the Louvre is haunted by a mummy called Belphegor. This myth even spurred a French television series and film.n",

In recent years, there has been some controversy surrounding the garden and its maintenance, with debates over the use of pesticides and the removal of some of the park's trees. Despite these issues, the Tuileries Garden remains a popular and beloved destination for locals and tourists alike.nnToday, the Tuileries Gardens are a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.

In 1867, Gabriel Davioud built a more impressive fountain in the square, which (like the first fountain) was decorated with lions.nnThe square took its current shape as part of Baron Hausmann's vast renovation of Paris. The architect also built new barracks on the cities, to garrison troops useful in times of civil unrest. At the center of the Place de la R√©publique is a 31 feet (9.4 m) bronze statue of Marianne, the personification of the French Republic, holding aloft an olive branch in her right hand and resting her left on a tablet engraved with Droits de l'homme (the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen). The statue sits atop a monument which is 75 feet (23 m) high. Marianne is surrounded by three statues personifying liberty, equality, and fraternity, the values of the French Republic. These statues also evoke the three medieval theological virtues. Also at the base is a lion guarding a depiction of a ballot box.nnThe monument was created by the brothers Charles and L√©opold Morice. Leopold executed the sculptural segments, while Charles executed the architectural segments. The monument was chosen as part of an art competition announced in early 1879 by the Paris City Council, which sought to create a Monument to the French Republic in honor of the 90th anniversary of the French Revolution, to be erected on the Place de la R√©publique. The Morice statue was chosen by the jury, but a vociferous minority opinion among jury members claimed precedence for the second prize, the submission of Jules Dalou, who had just returned from exile in England. Dalou's statue, which was completely different in style, impressed the jury so much that it was decided in early 1880 to erect his monument to the Republic on the",

  "Long": "Place des Vosges, originally known as Place Royale, is the oldest planned square in Paris and embodies one of the first European programs of royal city planning. Built by Henri IV from 1605 to 1612 on the site of the H√¥tel des Tournelles, it was a prototype of the residential squares of European cities that were to come. The square is located in the Marais district and straddles the dividing-line between the 3rd and 4th arrondissements of Paris.nnWhat was new about Place Royale in 1612 was that the housefronts were all built to the same design, probably by Jean Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau, of red brick with strips of stone quoins over vaulted arcades that stand on square pillars. The steeply-pitched blue slate roofs are pierced with discreet small-paned dormers above the pedimented dormers that stand upon the cornices. Only the north range was built with the vaulted ceilings that the ‚Äúgalleries‚Äù were meant to have.nnPlace Royale was a fashionable and expensive square to live in during the 17th and 18th centuries, attracting the Parisian nobility. Cardinal Richelieu had an equestrian bronze of Louis XIII erected in the centre, and it was often the place for the nobility to chat and served as a meeting place for them. It was renamed Place des Vosges in 1799 when the d√©partement of Vosges became the first to pay taxes supporting a campaign of the Revolutionary army.nnToday, the square is planted with a bosquet of mature lindens set in grass and gravel, surrounded by clipped lindens. It is a charming and picturesque place to visit, with elegant 17th-century buildings, numerous art galleries, trendy cafes and restaurants, and a lively atmosphere. Place des Vosges is a must-see attraction in Paris for anyone interested in history, architecture, or just looking for a pleasant place to relax and enjoy the beauty of the city.",

The mahJ was created in 1985 by Claude-G√©rard Marcus, Victor Klagsbald, and Alain Erlande-Brandenburg with the goal of providing Paris with an ambitious museum dedicated to Judaism and presenting national collections acquired from the reserves of the national museum of the Middle Ages. At the time, only a modest museum devoted to Judaism existed in Paris on the rue des Saules.nnThe project was backed by the City of Paris and the ministry of Culture, represented by Jack Lang, Minister of Culture. The museum was inaugurated in 1998 after being led by Laurence Sigal, who oversaw the redesign of the interior of the building. The decision to set up the museum in the Marais was a conscious one. Since the end of the 18th century, a large population of Jews has lived in the Marais. Today, the Marais has been transformed into a trendy neighborhood, but it remains a cultural center for museums such as the mus√©e Carnavalet, the mus√©e Picasso, and the M√©morial de la Shoah (Memorial for the Holocaust).nnThe mahJ's permanent collection was assembled from three main sources. The first is the Mus√©e d‚Äôart juif de Paris, whose collection was given to the mahJ. It consisted mainly of European religious objects, graphic works by Russian and German Jewish artists and artists from the School of Paris, and architectural models of European synagogues destroyed by the Nazis. The second source is the Mus√©e national du Moyen-Age in Paris,",

During the Second Empire, the architect Th√©odore Ballu restored the tower, placing it on a pedestal and designing a small city park around it. This coincided with the construction of the rue de Rivoli and the avenue Victoria nearby, requiring huge quantities of earth to be removed to ensure the rue de Rivoli a smooth flat path. The pedestal allowed the tower to retain its original elevation: nowadays, the change in ground level can best be appreciated in rue St-Bon, just northeast of the tower, where a staircase leads up to the original street level at rue de la Verrerie.nnToday, the Tour Saint-Jacques is considered a national historic landmark and listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.",

Monuments to writers and artists, a small-scale model of the Statue of Liberty, and one modern sculpture by Zadkine were later added.nnIn the basin, children sail model boats. The garden also includes an orchard, a puppet theatre, a vintage carousel, and a large fenced-in playground for young children and their parents. Free musical performances are presented in a gazebo on the grounds, and there is a small caf√© restaurant nearby. The orangerie displays art, photography, and sculptures.nnThe garden's central axis is extended by the central esplanade of the rue de l'Observatoire, where sculptures of the Four Times of Day alternate with columns and culminate at the southern end with the Fountain of the Observatory or the Fontaine des Quatre-Parties-du-Monde. The bronze fountain represents the work of four sculptors, and most importantly, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux who sculpted the four nude women supporting the globe, representing the Four Continents of classical iconography.nnThe Luxembourg Garden is a must-see destination for any visitor to Paris. With its beautiful gardens, sculptures, model sailboats, playgrounds, and more, there's something for everyone to enjoy.",

  "Long": "The Mus√©e de Cluny-Mus√©e National du Moyen √Çge, also called Mus√©e de Cluny, is a museum located in the heart of Paris, in the 5th arrondissement. The museum houses an impressive collection of art from the Middle Ages and is known for its iconic series of six 15th-century tapestries known as The Lady and the Unicorn. The museum building is a unique combination of two different structures: the Roman-era Thermes de Cluny and the 15th-century H√¥tel de Cluny, which was the Parisian mansion of the Abbey of Cluny.nnOriginally, the mansion was part of a larger complex that included a religious college. In the late 15th century, Jacques d'Amboise, abbot in commendam of Cluny 1485‚Äì1510, rebuilt the Cluny mansion using Gothic and early Renaissance elements. The mansion was later used by Mary Tudor, sister of Henry VIII of England, James V of Scotland and several 17th-century papal nuncios, including Mazarin. During the French Revolution in 1789, the mansion was confiscated by the state, and for the next three decades served various purposes, including the use of the former Abbots' chapel as a dissection room.nnIn 1832, the mansion was bought by Alexandre Du Sommerard, an archeologist and art collector who used it to display his large collection of medieval and Renaissance objects. The French state purchased the collection upon Du Sommerard's death in 1842, and the building was opened as a museum in 1843. The museum's buildings were restored by the architect Albert Lenoir.nnIn the late 1940s, a new museography was created, with a thematic display of works focusing on different workmanship categories and techniques. In 1977, the museum's Renaissance art collections were transferred to the newly created Mus√©e National de la Renaissance at the Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen in the northern outskirts of Paris, freeing additional space for medieval artworks. In 2011, a comprehensive renovation project, known as Cluny 4, was initiated by the French culture ministry, which included a redesign of the Lady and the Unicorn display in 2013 and the chronologically reorganized display of medieval art collections from 2019 to 2022.",

The center of the attic level was decorated with geometric motifs in colored marble, replaced in 1862 with a bas-relief of scrolls and children. The fountain was inaugurated in 1860, featuring a statue of the Archangel Michael wrestling with the devil in the central niche.nnIn 1870, during the French-German War, the fountain was threatened by a mob and appeared to have been damaged during the 1871 Paris Commune.

The church is famous for its shrine to St. Genevi√®ve, the patron saint of Paris, and for the tombs of Blaise Pascal and Jean Racine.nnThe church was built adjacent to the Abbey of Sainte-Genevieve, founded in 502, and the two buildings were connected. During the Gallo-Roman era, the Parisii tribe of Lutetia gradually settled a hill on the left bank of the Seine, called Mount Lucotecius. In the 6th century, Clovis, the King of the Franks, built a basilica at the top of the hill, dedicated to the Apostles Peter and Paul. Clovis was buried there, along with his wife Clotilde, and several kings of the Merovingian dynasty.nnThe construction of the present-day church began in the late 15th century and continued through the 16th century in the flamboyant Gothic style. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the church of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont enjoyed great prestige. The remains of a number of prominent scientists and artists were interred there, including Pierre Perrault, the painter Eustache Le Sueur, and Blaise Pascal. Those of Racine were transferred in 1711 from Port-Royal to Saint-Etienne. In 1744, King Louis XV decided to replace the nearby abbey with an even larger church, which eventually became the Paris Panth√©on.nnDuring the French Revolution, the church was closed and turned into a Temple of Filial Piety. The sculpture, decoration, and stained glass suffered extensive damage, and many church treasures and relics disappeared. Catholic worship was finally restored in 1803, under the Concordat of 1801. Under the Second Empire of Napoleon III, the church was extensively restored by the Paris city architect Victor Baltard between 1865 and 1868. The facade was restored and increased in height, and sculpture and stained glass that were destroyed during the Revolution were replaced.",

It was constructed between 1843 and 1848 by architect Louis Visconti, who also designed the tomb of Napoleon. The fountain was commissioned by Rambuteau, the prefect of the Seine in the government of King Louis Philippe I, who began an ambitious program to improve the city's water supply and build new fountains. Rambuteau built 200 kilometers of new water mains and 1700 small fountains to supply water, which allowed monumental fountains to be purely decorative rather than sources of drinking water.nnThe Fontaine Saint-Sulpice was designed with a religious theme in mind, as it was placed in front of a church and near an important seminary. Visconti prepared several different projects for the fountain in March 1843 to the Conseil des batiments civil, and after some modifications, the project was approved, and construction took place between 1843 and 1848. The final fountain had two distinct parts; the fountain itself, composed of three octagonal basins. The second basin was decorated with sculptures of lions made of stone from Derre, which had the coat of arms of Paris, and the third had pots which spouted water.

The president, typically a member of the largest party, presides over the Assembly's sessions, ensuring orderly proceedings and adherence to parliamentary norms. Vice presidents from various political parties assist the president, fostering a sense of inclusivity and representing the broad spectrum of political ideologies present in the Assembly.nnLocated in the esteemed Palais Bourbon on the Left Bank of the Seine in Paris, the National Assembly has a rich historical legacy. The Palais Bourbon serves as a symbol of democratic governance and has witnessed countless debates, discussions, and decisions that have shaped the course of the nation. Guarded by the Republican Guards, the Assembly stands as a beacon of democratic principles and the rule of law.nnThe National Assembly's term spans five years, coinciding with the presidential term. However, the President of France has the authority to dissolve the Assembly and call for new elections under certain circumstances. This power, though rarely exercised, allows the President to address political stalemates and seek a fresh mandate from the electorate. Such dissolutions have become rarer since the 2000 French constitutional referendum, which reduced the presidential term from seven to five years.nnOne distinguishing feature of the National Assembly is its seating arrangement, which reflects the political spectrum. Following a tradition initiated during the French Revolution, left-wing parties sit on the left side of the president's seat, while right-wing parties occupy the right side. This symbolic arrangement visually represents the ideological divisions and political landscape within the Assembly.nnThrough lively debates, committee work, and voting processes, the National Assembly fulfills its legislative duties. D√©put√©s propose laws and amendments, engage in deliberations, and exercise oversight over the executive branch. The Assembly also has the power to overthrow the government through a motion of no confidence, reinforcing the principles of checks and balances.n",
  "Long": "At the core of French democracy lies the National Assembly, an institution that upholds the principles of representative governance and legislative decision-making. As the lower house of the bicameral French Parliament, the National Assembly wields significant influence in shaping laws, policies, and the nation's trajectory.nnComprising 577 d√©put√©s, the Assembly serves as a platform for diverse political voices and ideologies. Elected through a two-round system, d√©put√©s represent single-member constituencies across the country, ensuring regional representation and a direct link between the people and their elected representatives. Each d√©put√© holds the title of delegate or envoy and assumes the responsibility of advocating for the interests and concerns of their constituents.nnUnder the leadership of the president of the National Assembly, currently Ya√´l Braun-Pivet, the d√©put√©s engage in rigorous debates, committee work, and voting processes to shape the legislative agenda. The president, typically a member of the largest party in the Assembly, presides over the sessions, maintaining order and upholding parliamentary rules. Vice presidents from different political spectrums contribute to the inclusive nature of the Assembly, ensuring that diverse perspectives are represented and respected.nnThe official seat of the National Assembly is the illustrious Palais Bourbon, located in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. This historic and iconic building has been the witness to countless pivotal moments in French political history. From passionate speeches to intense negotiations, the Palais Bourbon embodies the democratic spirit and serves as a symbol of the nation's commitment to governance by the people.nnThe National Assembly operates within a five-year term, aligning with the presidential term. However, the President of France holds the power to dissolve the Assembly and call for new elections if deemed necessary. This authority, although rarely exercised, provides a mechanism for the President to seek a fresh mandate or address political impasses. It serves as a means to ensure the responsiveness and accountability of the legislative branch.nnThe Assembly's relations with the executive branch are crucial to the functioning of the government. The National Assembly has the authority to overthrow the executive government, including the Prime Minister and other ministers, through a motion of no confidence. This power acts as a check on the government's actions and ensures parliamentary oversight. In cases of cohabitation, where the President of the Republic and the National Assembly are from opposing parties, delicate negotiations and compromises are required to facilitate effective governance.nnThe legislative process in the National Assembly involves the introduction and deliberation of law proposals. These proposals can originate from the Government or individual Members of Parliament. Through the examination of permanent parliamentary commissions and plenary sessions, the proposals are scrutinized, debated, and amended to create robust and effective legislation. The National Assembly's role in the legislative process is vital, as laws must pass through both chambers of Parliament, including the Senate, before being enacted.nnDeputies of the National Assembly receive a salary and various allowances to support their work. Parliamentary immunity protects deputies from legal action related to their legislative activities. However, the accumulation of mandates is restricted to ensure focus and prevent conflicts of interest. Deputies are also subject to ethical guidelines and transparency measures to maintain the integrity of the legislative process.nnThe National Assembly, through its debates, decisions, and legislative actions, shapes the course of the nation. It stands as a forum for democratic deliberation, where diverse voices converge to address societal challenges, protect citizens' rights, and shape the future of France. As a cornerstone of the French political system, the National Assembly upholds democratic principles, promotes accountability, and ensures the representation of the people's will in the legislative process.",

  "Medium": "At the Mus√©e Rodin, visitors can explore the exceptional sculptures and artistic legacy of Auguste Rodin. During his residency at the Villa des Brillants in Meudon, Rodin utilized the H√¥tel Biron as his workshop, eventually donating his entire collection of sculptures to the French State. This generous act, accompanied by the condition that the buildings be transformed into a museum dedicated to his works, led to the establishment of the Mus√©e Rodin.

  "Long": "The Mus√©e Rodin boasts two notable locations: the H√¥tel Biron in Paris and the Villa des Brillants in Meudon. The H√¥tel Biron, a magnificent mansion built between 1727 and 1732, serves as the primary site of the museum. The building, adorned with classical architectural elements and rocaille decoration, opened its doors to the public as the Mus√©e Rodin on August 4, 1919. Over the years, the H√¥tel Biron has welcomed esteemed artists and thinkers, including Jean Cocteau, Henri Matisse, Isadora Duncan, and Rainer Maria Rilke. It was Rilke's future wife, Clara Westhoff, who first informed Rodin about the property. Initially, Rodin rented four ground-floor rooms for his studios in 1908, gradually occupying the entire building by 1911. During this period, Rodin engaged in negotiations with the French state, officially announcing his intention to donate his works, drawings, and collection of antiquities on the condition that they be housed at the H√¥tel Biron and remain his residence for life.nnIn 1916, a law was passed, granting the French state the authority to accept Rodin's donations and allocate the H√¥tel Biron and its grounds to become a museum. L√©once B√©n√©dite was appointed as the executor of Rodin's will and entrusted with managing the artist's heritage and organizing the future museum.nnDesignated as a historical monument in 1926, the H√¥tel Biron and its grounds have undergone significant restoration and renovation work to enhance their role as a museum. The most recent restoration project, completed on Rodin's 175th birthday on November 12, 2015, cost 16 million euros and was celebrated as a moral duty by France's Culture Minister.nnThe H√¥tel Biron is a testament to classical architecture and rocaille decoration, providing a fitting backdrop for Rodin's sculptures.

The picturesque garden features a small lake and a casual restaurant, offering a tranquil environment for art appreciation.nnBeyond the H√¥tel Biron, the Mus√©e Rodin extends its presence to the Villa des Brillants in Meudon. Acquired by Rodin in 1895, this Louis XIII-style house served as his residence and a hub for his creative endeavors. Rodin employed a team of assistants, workers, and casters at the villa, and it became a gathering place for friends, admirers, and prominent figures. After Rodin's passing, the villa and studio were transformed into a museum, allowing visitors to experience the ambiance of his working environment. The museum in Meudon exhibits numerous plasters, including casts for monumental works like The Burghers of Calais and The Gates of Hell, providing insights into Rodin's artistic process and the evolution of his creations.nnIn addition to its permanent collections, the Mus√©e Rodin hosts temporary exhibitions dedicated to Rodin himself. These exhibitions explore various aspects of his artistic career, including his approach to sculpture and his influences. The museum has also embraced contemporary art, featuring exhibitions by artists like Anthony Caro, Eug√®ne Dodeigne, √âtienne Bossut, and Wim Delvoye.nnThe Mus√©e Rodin is easily accessible via public transportation, with the nearby M√©tro stop, Varenne, showcasing some of Rodin's sculptures on the platform.

As your tour guide, I will take you on a journey through this iconic location, sharing fascinating facts and information that will enhance your experience as a visitor.nnThe Champ de Mars, also known as the Field of Mars, is located in the enchanting seventh arrondissement of Paris. It stretches between two famous landmarks: the magnificent Eiffel Tower to the northwest and the prestigious √âcole Militaire to the southeast. Its name pays tribute to the Campus Martius in Rome, dedicated to the Roman god of war, and reflects its historical association with military drills and parades.nnOriginally, this vast green space was part of Grenelle, an area reserved for market gardening. Local citizens cultivated small plots to grow fruits, vegetables, and flowers for the local market. However, the soil here proved to be less fertile for farming.nnThe transformation of the Champ de Mars began in 1765 with the construction of the √âcole Militaire, a magnificent military school designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Originally, the grounds for military drills were planned to the south of the school, but the decision was made to create an esplanade to the north instead. This led to the construction of the noble facade that now encloses the Champ de Mars. The grounds were leveled, a large ditch was added, and a beautiful avenue of elms was planted. To create a visually pleasing perspective, the Isle of Swans, a riverine islet, was incorporated into the park.nnThe Champ de Mars has witnessed several significant events throughout history. On July 14, 1790, the first Federation Day celebration, now known as Bastille Day, took place here, marking the one-year anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. However, the park also witnessed tragic moments, such as the massacre on the Champ de Mars on July 17, 1791, during the French Revolution.nnDuring the French Revolution, the Champ de Mars became a site of grand festivals. One notable event was the Festival of the Supreme Being on June 8, 1794. The painter Jacques-Louis David designed an impressive Altar of the Nation atop an artificial mountain, adorned with a symbolic tree of liberty. This festival is considered one of the most successful of its kind during the Revolution.nnThe Champ de Mars has not only played a historical role but has also hosted significant cultural events. In 2012, it was the site of the United Buddy Bears exhibit, featuring over 140 two-meter-tall bear sculptures representing different countries. These bears promote values such as peace, love, tolerance, and international understanding.nnFor film enthusiasts, the Champ de Mars may seem familiar as it served as a filming location for the 1985 James Bond film A View to a Kill. In this thrilling movie, James Bond, played by Roger Moore, embarked on an exciting chase through the streets of Paris, including a scene where he drives a hijacked taxi along the Champ de Mars.nnSports enthusiasts will also find activities to enjoy at the Champ de Mars. The park features a basketball court and a football field, providing opportunities for friendly matches and recreational games.

However, Napoleon ultimately rejected Fulton's projects, and the inventor took his Panoramas to London in pursuit of new opportunities.nnDuring the early 19th century, the streets of Paris were narrow, dark, muddy, and overcrowded, making shopping a less than pleasant experience. The Passage des Panoramas, along with other covered galleries like the Palais Royal, Passage Feydau, and Passage du Caire, revolutionized the concept of shopping by providing shoppers with a sheltered and illuminated space to explore.nnIn the 1830s, architect Jean-Louis Victor Grisart undertook a renovation of the passage, adding three additional galleries within the block of houses. The Saint-Marc gallery runs parallel to the main passage, while the gallery of the Vari√©t√©s provides access to the artists' entrance of the Th√©√¢tre de Vari√©t√©s. The Feydeau and Montmartre galleries complete the ensemble, each contributing to the passage's unique character and charm.nnThroughout its storied past, the Passage des Panoramas has been a haven for diverse businesses and artisans.

According to legend, this ancient fortress was established in the 4th century AD during King Varaz-Bakur's reign. Over the centuries, it has endured various invasions, shifts in rule, and the relentless march of time, but its walls tell a story of resilience and persistence.  Nestled between Tbilisi's therapeutic sulfur baths and lush botanical gardens, Narikala Fortress is a historic treasure trove waiting to be discovered. It's composed of two walled sections, each with their own distinct narratives. Although it initially fell into Persian hands, it was reclaimed by the kings of Kartli in the 5th century. It experienced significant expansion in the 7th century under the Umayyads and later under King David the Builder in the 11th century.  Interestingly, the fortress received its present name from the Mongols who, impressed by its formidable nature, named it Narin Qala, translating to Little Fortress. Despite its title, there's nothing 'little' about the history and culture enshrined within its walls. The existing fortifications mainly date back to the 16th and 17th centuries, silently narrating tales of past inhabitants and their determination to safeguard their city.  At the heart of Narikala is the recently restored St Nicholas church. Although the original 13th-century church succumbed to a fire, the reconstructed version, completed in 1996-1997, successfully mirrors its predecessor. It adheres to the prescribed cross architectural style, with doors gracing three sides of the structure.  The inner sanctum of St Nicholas church offers a vibrant canvas of Georgia's religious and historical journey. Its walls are adorned with frescos, visually narrating scenes from the Bible as well as significant episodes from Georgia's history. These artistic renditions offer a unique opportunity to appreciate the intertwining of faith and history in this ancient land.  Tragically, an earthquake in 1827 significantly damaged parts of the fortress, resulting in some sections being demolished. However, like a phoenix, Narikala has risen from its ashes time and again, reinforcing its image as a symbol of Georgia's tenacity.  Today, as you wander around its ancient walls, gaze at the city sprawled below, and admire the artwork within the St Nicholas church, Narikala Fortress provides a mesmerizing snapshot of Georgia's past. It's more than just a historical monument; it's a testament to the resilience of a city that has successfully preserved its rich heritage while advancing into the future.",

  "Long": "Welcome to the imposing Holy Trinity Cathedral of Tbilisi, affectionately known as Sameba. Towering over Georgia's capital, this cathedral serves as the heart of the Georgian Orthodox Church. Built between 1995 and 2004, Sameba ranks as the third-tallest Eastern Orthodox cathedral globally and one of the largest religious buildings by total area.  The idea to build Sameba, conceived in 1989, aimed to commemorate 1,500 years of autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church and 2,000 years since Jesus's birth. However, civil unrest delayed this ambitious plan until 1995 when construction finally commenced.  Sameba's architectural design, crafted by Archil Mindiashvili, is an elegant blend of traditional Georgian styles with Byzantine undertones, paying tribute to Georgia's historical architectural evolution. Rising from the historic neighborhood of Avlabari on Elia Hill, the cathedral overlooks the Kura River, offering a stunning view to those visiting this sacred site.  Stepping inside, you'll find an extraordinary interior featuring nine chapels, five of which are nestled underground. Each chapel tells its own story through the beautiful murals painted by Amiran Goglidze and his team. With a floor of marble tiles and an altar soon to be embellished with mosaic, the cathedral is a breathtaking manifestation of Georgian craftsmanship.  The cathedral's completion in 2004 was celebrated on St. George's Day, with its consecration attended by Orthodox Churches' high-ranking representatives, leaders of other religious communities in Georgia, and political figures. This event underlined the significance of Sameba as a beacon of national and spiritual revival. The fact that its construction was funded primarily by anonymous donations from various strata of society is a testament to the shared respect and dedication to the Georgian Orthodox Church.  The Sameba complex includes a free-standing bell-tower, the residence of the Patriarch, a monastery, clerical seminary, and theological academy, and several workshops, representing a comprehensive spiritual center for worship, learning, and reflection. Despite a somewhat controversial history regarding the land it occupies, which was once the Khojavank Armenian cemetery, Sameba stands as a testament to the resilience and unity of the Georgian people.  However, as visitors, while you marvel at its grandeur and appreciate the spiritual and artistic treasures housed within, it's essential to remember the checkered past of the land it occupies. This encourages a broader understanding of Georgia's intricate social fabric and history, underscoring the importance of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence between different cultures and faiths. In doing so, Sameba, in all its splendor, serves as a reminder of Georgia's enduring spirit and its path towards unity and prosperity.   ",

  "Long": "Greetings from the heart of Tbilisi, Georgia! You are standing in Freedom Square, a place that is more than just a geographical location, but a tapestry of Georgia's history, struggle, and ultimate triumph over oppression. Located at the eastern end of Rustaveli Avenue, this square carries with it a fascinating history.  Under Imperial Russia, this square was known as Erivansky Square, named after Ivan Paskevich, a Ukrainian general who earned his title by conquering Erivan (now Yerevan) for the Russian Empire. But as political tides shifted, so did the square's name. During the Soviet era, it became Beria Square, then Lenin Square, mirroring the change in power and ideologies of the time.  It was only after 1918, when the First Georgian Republic was founded following the Russian Empire's collapse, that the square got its current name: Freedom Square. This was more than a name; it was a declaration of Georgia's hard-fought sovereignty. Since then, the square has been a stage for momentous historical events. It was the site of the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery and various mass demonstrations calling for Georgia's independence from the Soviet Union. Even in recent history, Freedom Square was where U.S. President George W. Bush and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili addressed a crowd of around 100,000 people in 2005, marking the end of World War II's 60th anniversary.  Freedom Square isn't just a place of political significance. It's a hub of culture and art, too. The most prominent feature is the Liberty Monument, a stunning piece by Zurab Tsereteli, featuring St George triumphantly slaying the dragon. This isn't just a heroic scene from legend; it's a metaphor for Georgia's victory over its past oppressors. Nearby, a bust of Alexander Pushkin, a famed Russian poet, adds to the square's artistic allure.  On the square's northern side, you'll notice an open space with a fountain, a quiet place to rest and take in the area's vibrancy. This place was once the burial ground of Simon Ter-Petrossian, famously known as Kamo, a renowned communist figure whose remains were moved to an undisclosed location during Stalin's rule.  Surrounding the square, several important buildings add to its grandeur. The Tbilisi City Assembly, the former Bank of Georgia head office, and the Courtyard by Marriott Tbilisi all contribute to the unique architectural landscape. There are also ongoing works to accommodate the Old Tbilisi local government office here.  The significance of Freedom Square goes beyond its historical and artistic importance. It stands as a symbol of the spirit of the Georgian people - a testament to their enduring resilience and their journey from subjugation to freedom.

Patarkatsishvili owned the park as part of a charitable project, along with other commercial assets in Georgia.  In 2007, due to Patarkatsishvili's political opposition to the National Movement Party, he fell out of favor with then-President Mikhail Saakashvili. His assets, including Mtatsminda Park, were controversially seized by the government. After Patarkatsishvili's death in 2008, his widow, Inna Gudavadze, fought for the return of the park and other assets, believing it her duty to continue her husband's projects for Georgia and its people. After a four-year-long legal struggle, the park was finally returned to the Patarkatsishvili family in 2011.  Today, Mtatsminda Park stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of the Georgian people. It's a symbol of the nation's past and its journey into the future.

Residing on the vibrant Rustaveli Avenue, the theater is housed in an exotic Moorish Revival edifice, a testament to the design genius of Victor Schr√∂ter. While its fa√ßade invokes a definitive Oriental allure, the interior sings a different tune, presenting the traditional layout, foyers, and main hall of a European opera house, adorned with colored velvet, gold, silver, and imported silks.  Throughout its history, the theater has proven its resilience, overcoming multiple fires and reconstruction periods, including a significant restoration completed in 2016. Its persistence mirrors the Georgian people's resilience, making the opera house a symbol of the nation's unwavering commitment to culture and the arts, even amidst adversity.

Over the years, the stage has seen a procession of esteemed performers, from the likes of Montserrat Caball√© and Jos√© Carreras to local talents showcasing traditional Georgian-language performances. The breadth of its performances exemplifies its commitment to preserving Georgian culture while embracing global artistic trends.  However, the theater is not just a celebration of music and dance; it's a testament to Georgia's tumultuous past. The establishment of the opera house was a significant part of the political processes following Georgia's annexation by the Russian Empire in 1801. To appease and integrate Georgian aristocracy into Imperial society, Count Mikhail Vorontsov, the then Viceroy of the Caucasus, endorsed the creation of the opera house, fostering a cultural initiative that held considerable political implications.  The original theater, an opulent spectacle with artwork by Russian painter Grigory Gagarin, was reduced to rubble in a devastating fire in 1874. However, the tragedy spurred the city to resurrect the cultural icon. A contest for a new architectural design resulted in Schr√∂ter's winning design and the construction of the now-familiar Oriental-inspired structure.  Its grand opening in 1851 welcomed the high society of Tbilisi, marking the beginning of a new era in Georgian arts. It was a beacon of light during the tumultuous political climate of the 19th century, offering the people of Tbilisi an escape into a world of music, dance, and drama. Over the years, it has remained a place of cultural significance, even during periods of political instability, including the unrest in the 1990s.  Today, as the heart of Tbilisi's cultural life, the theater continues to host a diverse range of performances, serving as a platform for national celebrations and high-profile receptions. A visit to the Georgian National Opera and Ballet Theater is not just a cultural experience; it's a journey through Georgia's past and present, a tale of resilience, revival, and the enduring power of art. A tour of this iconic institution is a must for every visitor seeking to understand the soul of Tbilisi.",

This basilica, built in the 6th century by King Dachi of Iberia, holds the title as the oldest surviving church in the city. Originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary, it was renamed Anchiskhati in 1675 when a revered icon of the Savior was moved here from the Ancha monastery to safeguard it from an Ottoman invasion.  The basilica's history is a testament to Georgia's turbulent past, having been rebuilt several times due to wars with Persians and Turks. A significant transformation occurred in the 1870s when a dome was added to the structure. During the Soviet era, the church served secular purposes - first as a museum of handicrafts, then an art studio.

  "Long": "Greetings, fellow explorers! Let's step back in time to the 6th century with the oldest surviving church in Tbilisi - the Anchiskhati Basilica of St Mary. King Dachi of Iberia, who made Tbilisi his capital, laid the foundations of this historic structure, originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The name 'Anchiskhati' was adopted in 1675 when the precious icon of the Savior, a masterpiece by the 12th-century goldsmith Beka Opizari, was relocated here from the Ancha monastery in present-day Turkey to evade an Ottoman invasion.  The basilica's tumultuous history is a reflection of the wars between Georgia and its invaders, the Persians and Turks, which led to its repeated damage and restoration between the 15th and 17th centuries. Catholicos Domenti added a brick belfry near the Anchiskhati Basilica in 1675, and a dome was introduced in the 1870s, significantly altering its appearance.  During the Soviet period, religious activities at Anchiskhati Basilica were halted, and it transitioned into a museum for handicrafts and later an art studio. However, the 1500th Jubilee of Tbilisi in the late 1950s sparked a wave of restoration efforts, reviving the basilica's 17th-century facade. It wasn't until 1991, following Georgia's independence, that the church returned to its sacred purpose.  Walking through Anchiskhati Basilica is like traversing through time. The basilica showcases a unique three-span design divided by two horseshoe-shaped abutments, a mark of its antique construction. Originally built with blocks of yellow tuff stone, the church now prominently features bricks, a result of the restorations in the late 20th century. Despite having entrances on three sides, only the western one is currently in use.  Inside, the Anchiskhati Basilica boasts an array of artwork, the most remarkable of which is the altarpiece commissioned by Catholicos Nikoloz Amilakhvari in 1683. Alongside it, you will find paintings from the 19th century, each one a silent narrator of Georgia's rich history and religious traditions.  But Anchiskhati Basilica isn't just a silent witness to history. It's a thriving cultural center, home to the world-renowned Anchiskhati Choir, the leading exponent of Georgian polyphonic choral music. Listening to their harmonious melodies within the ancient walls of the basilica is a soul-stirring experience, a must-try during your visit.  From surviving invasions and wars to serving secular purposes and ultimately reclaiming its religious significance, Anchiskhati Basilica embodies the resilience of Georgian spirit. Its history, architecture, and cultural offerings make it an unmissable destination in Tbilisi.

Today, it's a veritable tourist hotspot with a distinct structure, despite its humble beginnings.  The market is spread across the Dry Bridge, its name an echo of times when it spanned the Mtkvari River. Our exploration begins with the iconic flea market. Here, personal histories unfold through Soviet memorabilia, old medals, and vintage items. Expect to spot items that tell tales of the Soviet past, such as war medals, ID books, photographs, and many symbolic references to Lenin and Stalin. Mixed in with these, discover an eclectic array of Soviet-issue film cameras, caviar tins, and other items dating back to Georgia's days as a Socialist Republic. If you are a collector, you'll be captivated by the selection of coins, matchboxes, and stamps, though do inquire about their provenance.  As we stroll into the 9 March Park, we're welcomed by the vibrant art & handicrafts market. A medley of colorful felt shawls, knitted socks, Georgian drinking horns, decorative swords, and miniature clay qvevri dot the stands. An artist's paradise, the market houses an avenue where artists set up easels and display their work. A little further, the hidden antiques market awaits, where an exquisite collection of porcelain, ceramics, chandeliers, dinner sets, and vases beckons you to uncover hidden gems.  Our journey doesn't end here. The book market, located at the beautiful riverside Dedaena Park, offers a peaceful respite. Paris-style numbered booths present a collection of old books, postcards, posters, and other paper goods. The riverside walk here is an idyllic setting for a leisurely stroll.  The Dry Bridge Market is open from 10 am until 5 pm daily, with a short pause during major holidays and extreme weather. Though you can visit any day, weekends offer a more vibrant atmosphere, brimming with vendors and shoppers. Remember, cash is king here, as vendors only accept paper money. The art of polite haggling is also part of the experience, and it's an opportunity to engage with the vendors, who are usually quite friendly and intrigued by tourists.  Photography is generally accepted here, but do respect people's wishes if they prefer not to be photographed. Public restrooms are available for your convenience, including new facilities in the underpass inside Dedaena Park.  After you've filled your bags with unique treasures and memories, it's time to satiate your appetite. The surrounding area is peppered with delightful eateries and cafes. Atoneli Street is home to Caf√© Daphna, famous for its khinkali, while Santino is a haven for coffee lovers. A short walk along the river from the antique market takes you to one of the best restaurants in Tbilisi, The King and The Bird.

Despite multiple reconstructions, the basic elements remain from King David the Builder's design in 1112, offering glimpses into the architectural brilliance of that era.  Stepping inside, you'll be awestruck by the striking murals composed by Russian artist Grigory Gagarin between 1850 and 1860. These vibrant pieces, along with those by Georgian artist Levan Tsutskiridze from the 1980s, lend the cathedral's interior a unique artistic aura. Gagarin also designed the stone iconostasis dating back to the 1850s, replacing the original wooden one burned during the Persian invasion in 1795.  One of the cathedral's most treasured artifacts is the Grapevine cross, associated with Saint Nino. As per tradition, this Cappadocian woman forged the cross and was instrumental in introducing Christianity to the Caucasus in the 4th century. It's an artifact of spiritual significance that connects modern Georgia with its ancient Christian roots.  The cathedral's history intertwines with significant events in Georgia's past. The Russian Imperial manifesto announcing Georgia's annexation was first made public here in 1802. It was a momentous event, shaping Georgia's future. The cathedral has also served as the main Georgian Orthodox Cathedral and the seat of the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia until the Holy Trinity Cathedral was consecrated in 2004.  The Sioni Cathedral was also the site of various restorations, including the cupola and vaults by the Metropolitan of Tbilisi, Elise Saginashvili, in the 17th century. It even continued functioning throughout the Soviet era, with partial renovations undertaken between 1980 and 1983.  Near the cathedral, within the courtyard, a three-story bell tower stands tall. This structure, dating from the 1425 reconstruction by King Alexander I and restored in 1939 after being largely destroyed by Persian Shah Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar in 1795, is another architectural marvel.  The Sioni Cathedral's journey is a remarkable narrative of resilience, strength, and enduring faith. As you explore its hallowed grounds, you're not just visiting a religious structure; you're stepping into a living testament of Georgian history, culture, and spirituality.    ",

This structure serves as an immense stone tapestry, detailing the rich tapestry of Georgia's history and religious influences. Masterminded by renowned Georgian-Russian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli in 1985, it remains an unfinished work of art. Its construction was halted in the early 1990s due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Russo Georgian War.  Dominating the landscape, the monument features 16 colossal pillars standing between 30 to 35 meters tall. The upper halves immortalize Georgian kings, queens, and heroes, while the lower halves weave tales from the life of Christ into stone. Additionally, you'll find a chapel and the grapevine cross of St. Nino, the woman who introduced Christianity to Georgia. Her symbol, the grapevine cross, is seen here in honor of her monumental influence.  The monument serves as a visual narration of the profound historical events that shaped Georgia. It commemorates the early eras when humans first settled in Georgia, evolving slowly since the Paleolithic Era. It pays homage to the advent of the agricultural revolution, marking the introduction of domesticated plants and agriculture that proved pivotal in the evolution of Georgian culture.  The Chronicle of Georgia also highlights Georgia's pottery-making and wine-brewing prowess, which played a critical role in the nation's cultural development. It records Georgia's annexation by Russia in 1783 and its incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1936, which led to the funding of this monument by Soviet funds.  Situated on a large hill, the Chronicle of Georgia provides an unparalleled panoramic view of Tbilisi. It is an excellent spot for tourists to capture the beauty of the city. Despite being overshadowed by Tbilisi's diverse array of attractions, it's an intriguing location that provides an insight into the nation's past and cultural heritage.  Just a stone's throw away from the monument, you'll find the Tbilisi Sea, an artificial lake built in 1953 that serves as a popular hangout for the locals. Although it's an artificial lake, its vast expanse and depth create the illusion of a sea. Its proximity to the monument makes the location all the more enticing for visitors looking to immerse themselves in Georgia's cultural and natural splendors.  Zurab Tsereteli, the mastermind behind this monument, has made substantial contributions to the art world with his monumental sculptures and architectural designs. His work on the Chronicle of Georgia coincides with his construction of the Friendship Forever in Moscow's Tishinskaya square, signifying the deep-rooted friendship between Russia and Georgia.  Despite its unfinished state, the Chronicle of Georgia stands as an impressive testament to Georgia's rich history, cultural development, and religious influence. It is a tangible chronicle that offers an unparalleled insight into Georgia's journey through the centuries. For those visiting Tbilisi, it presents a unique opportunity to connect with the nation's past and appreciate its cultural evolution.",

Constructed from 1904 to 1910, its architecture echoes the medieval Samtavisi Cathedral. Breathtaking frescoes by celebrated Georgian artist Lado Gudiashvili adorn the interior, illustrating Christian stories with ancient encaustic techniques. A site of deep historical and religious significance, Kashveti takes its name from an old legend featuring the 6th-century monk, David of Gareja, who proved his innocence against false accusations by causing a woman to give birth to a stone. This story, reflected in the church's name, weaves faith, history, and miracles together, attracting believers and tourists alike.",
  "Medium": "Welcome to the magnificent Kashveti Church of St. George, an architectural jewel standing proudly in central Tbilisi, opposite the Parliament building. Kashveti's design, crafted by the architect Leopold Bilfeldt, is inspired by the medieval Samtavisi Cathedral, culminating in a harmonious blend of Italian marble and carvings copied from various ancient churches in Georgia.  The church was built between 1904 and 1910, replacing a previous structure from 1753 that had fallen into disrepair. Notably, the construction was saved from Soviet destruction in the 1920s thanks to Neophyte Agladze, a local master stone carver who contributed to Kashveti's ornate design.  Upon entering, your eyes will be captivated by the exquisitely painted frescoes created by Lado Gudiashvili, one of Georgia's most influential painters. His work, a testament to the encaustic painting method, features timeless Christian narratives and has survived the test of time.  The church is deeply rooted in Georgian Christianity. Its name, kashveti, stems from an intriguing tale about the 6th-century monk David of Gareja, a figure in the group of the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers. Falsely accused of impregnating a woman, David prophesied she would give birth to a stone in his defense, which she indeed did. This miracle birth gave the church its name and enhances its allure as a symbol of faith, history, and miracles.

  "Long": "Welcome to the inspiring Kashveti Church of St. George, an embodiment of Georgian Orthodox tradition and artistic splendor. Sitting opposite the Parliament building on Tbilisi's bustling Rustaveli Avenue, Kashveti's majestic silhouette narrates stories of faith, resilience, and artistry.  Constructed between 1904 and 1910, this church stands on hallowed ground. Previous structures date back to the 6th century, each one testament to the enduring spirit of Georgian Christianity. Kashveti replaced a deteriorating church from 1753, with contributions from the Georgian nobility and bourgeoisie funding the project. Architect Leopold Bilfeldt's design drew inspiration from the medieval Samtavisi Cathedral, combining it with Italian marble and diverse Georgian carvings to create a harmonious blend of architectural styles.  Though the church faced demolition during the anti-religious Soviet regime in the 1920s, it was saved through the quick thinking of Neophyte Agladze. As a master stone carver, Agladze's passion for his work led him to rally support and prevent the church's destruction, allowing Kashveti to stand as a beacon of faith even today.  Kashveti's interior is as remarkable as its history. The church's walls are adorned with enchanting frescoes painted by Lado Gudiashvili, a leading figure in Georgian art. Utilizing the ancient and robust encaustic painting method, Gudiashvili breathed life into Christian narratives, creating an immersive and spiritual experience for all visitors.  At the heart of Kashveti's history is the legend of David of Gareja, one of the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers who evangelized Georgia in the 6th century. Falsely accused of impregnating a woman, David declared that she would birth a stone to prove his innocence. Miraculously, this prophecy came to pass, resulting in the church's name kashveti, which translates to birth of a stone. This miraculous event not only reinforced the sanctity of the site but also symbolized the unwavering resilience and faith of the Georgian people.  Today, Kashveti Church stands as an iconic symbol of Georgia's rich religious history, architectural splendor, and enduring faith. Its remarkable blend of design influences, stunning frescoes, and legendary origins make it a must-visit destination for any visitor to Tbilisi. Whether you are a history buff, an art enthusiast, or a spiritual seeker, the Kashveti Church of St. George promises an unforgettable experience.",

The House of Melik-Azaryants carries a melancholic tale of loss, mirrored in its ascetic appearance, tear-shaped windows, and funeral wreaths ‚Äî a father's tribute to his daughter who passed away during its construction.",
  "Long": "Welcome to the House of Melik-Azaryants, a historical monument of significant importance on Rustaveli Avenue, Tbilisi. This exceptional architectural gem was constructed by a wealthy Armenian merchant, Alexander Melik-Azaryants, in the Art Nouveau style between 1912-1915, reflecting Tbilisi's prevalent modernist architecture.  From its ornate stone-carved garlands and Czech sculptural reliefs that grace the facade, to the traditional Tbilisian wooden balconies that embellish the back, the house is an embodiment of textural contrast. The tale of its construction is as fascinating as its architecture. The merchant, initially outraged at the prospect of building on a landfill, eventually accepted the mayor's offer, leading to the creation of this unique edifice.  Notably, the house was the first multifunctional, modern-style building in all of Europe and Russia at the time. Housing hotel rooms, shops, a photo salon, preschool, cinema, art gallery, and a beautiful garden, it was a testament to innovative urban planning. The inclusion of amenities such as electricity, heating, and running water was a significant leap in the era's architectural standards.  However, the house also carries a sorrowful tale of a grieving father. Alexander Melik-Azaryants's daughter tragically passed away before its completion, leading him to dedicate the building to her memory. The house's sad and ascetic appearance, epitomized by teardrop windows and funeral wreaths, is a moving tribute to his loss.  During the Soviet Era, Azaryants‚Äôs property, including the house, was nationalized. He died in poverty, leaving behind this unique dwelling as his lasting legacy. Despite facing demolition threats several times, the house stands today as a cherished monument of Tbilisi's cultural heritage.  The House of Melik-Azaryants is not just a building; it is a symbol of enduring love, resilience, and innovation. Its architectural splendor and poignant history make it a must-visit site for any visitor to Tbilisi.",

  "Short": "The Virgin Mary Assumption Church of Metekhi, also known as Metekhi Church, is a key Georgian Orthodox Christian site in Tbilisi, dating back to the 13th century. Perched on the Metekhi Cliff, the church offers a breathtaking view of the old town across the Kura river. Its unique architecture, with three convex apses and a dome held internally by four pillars, make it a significant historical monument. The church's stone walls are adorned with intricate rock carvings, a testimony to Georgia's Golden Age. Metekhi also has a tragic history, notably the event of 1226, when around 100,000 citizens were executed for refusing to step on holy icons. Today, the church continues to be a place of worship and a fascinating historical site for tourists.",
  "Medium": "The Virgin Mary Assumption Church of Metekhi, located on a cliff overlooking the Kura river, is a stunning example of Georgian architectural grandeur, dating back to the 13th century. According to oral tradition, its origins could trace back to as early as the 5th century, built by the King Vakhtang I Gorgasali. However, most of its current structure was constructed under the reign of King Demetrius II, between 1278 and 1289 AD.  The church uniquely blends into the natural landscape, constructed to appear as an extension of the cliff. With three convex apses and a dome supported internally by four pillars, Metekhi's design differs from most churches of the time, making it a unique monument. The walls of the church are decorated with Georgian rock carvings, an artistic element characteristic of the Golden Age of 11th-12th centuries.  A tragic event in 1226 has been immortalized in the church's history. The Kwarazm-shah, Jalal ad-Din, ordered Tbilisi's citizens to step on religious icons or face execution. About 100,000 citizens who refused to desecrate their faith were executed, their heads floating down the Mtkvari River.  During the 17th century, the church underwent significant restorations due to damage from lightning. In the Soviet era, the church was used as a museum, theater, and even a prison, with prisoner names etched into its facade. It returned to its sacred function in 1988 and has since been a beacon of faith, history, and culture.",
  "Long": "Standing on the edge of the Metekhi Cliff, overlooking the old town of Tbilisi, lies the impressive structure of The Virgin Mary Assumption Church of Metekhi, an integral part of Georgia's rich history. Known locally as Metekhi Church, this Georgian Orthodox Christian place of worship has roots dating back to the 13th century, with oral tradition hinting at an even earlier foundation in the 5th century by the King Vakhtang I Gorgasali. Despite these early roots, the bulk of its current structure was erected under the rule of King Demetrius II between 1278 and 1289 AD.  An exquisite example of Georgian architecture, Metekhi Church seamlessly blends with its natural surroundings, designed to look like an extension of the cliff it sits upon. Its unique architectural style boasts three convex apses and a dome, supported internally by four pillars, standing in contrast to the typical two-pillar design of the 11th century. These structural elements contribute to Metekhi's uniqueness and the invaluable insights it provides into historical architectural trends.  The exterior walls, crafted from hewn quadras, have been adorned with traditional Georgian rock carvings, exuding a distinct charm associated with the Golden Age of 11th-12th centuries. The eastern facade features the best-preserved carvings, offering an intricate display of rhombic rosettes and convex architraves. While no original murals have survived inside, various icons, such as the 100000 martyrs, narrate stories of the past.  One of the most tragic events connected to the church took place in 1226 when the town was seized by troops led by Kwarazm-shah, Jalal ad-Din. He presented an appalling ultimatum to Tbilisi's inhabitants: step on religious icons from Sioni Church, which were laid on the Metekhi Bridge, or face beheading. Defying this sacrilegious command, about 100,000 citizens were executed, their heads sent floating down the Mtkvari River, a grim reminder of the price paid for steadfast faith.  Over the centuries, Metekhi Church has weathered a variety of transformations. In the 17th century, after a lightning strike, significant restoration work was undertaken. In the 18th century, changes were made, including the addition of a southern entrance and the substitution of original hewn quadras with bricks on the southern facade.  During the Soviet era, the church was repurposed several times. It served as a prison during the early Soviet era, with prisoners leaving their mark by scratching their names into the church's facade. It was then transformed into a depository for the National Museum of Art's collections and later served as a youth theater in the 1970s.  Despite the turbulent times and multiple threats of demolition, Metekhi Church survived and was reinstated as a place of worship in 1988. Today, this remarkable monument stands as a testament to Georgia's rich history, a symbol of resilient faith, and a captivating attraction for both locals and tourists alike, offering a unique glimpse into the country's religious, cultural, and architectural heritage.",
